CONCLUSION

To compare percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for
the treatment of lower calyceal calculi with diameter of 2-3 cm in patients with solitary kidney.
We retrospectively analyzed 76 cases of calculi in solitary kidney from 3 medical centers in China
between April 2013 and October 2016. Among them, 42 cases underwent PCNL, and 34 cases
underwent RIRS.
The operation time of the PCNL group (82.0 ± 27.9 minutes) was shorter than the RIRS group
(117.2 ± 23.1 min, P <.001). The intraoperative decrease in hemoglobin of the PCNL group was
5.4 ± 2.3 g/L, which was significantly higher than the RIRS group (1.8 ± 0.5 g/L, P <.001). The
postoperative hospital stay was 13.9 ± 1.6 days for PCNL, which was longer than the RIRS group
(7.3 ± 1.2 days, P < .001). PCNL achieved 85.7% (36 of 42) on 1-session stone-free rate, whereas
RIRS group was 58.8% (20 of 34, P = .008). The overall stone-free rates were 92.86% (39 of 42)
and 85.29% (29 of 34) for PCNL and RIRS, respectively (P >.05). The postoperative complication rate was similar between the RIRS group and the PCNL group.
For patients with solitary kidney, PCNL achieved a higher 1-session stone-free rate than RIRS in
the treatment of lower calyceal calculi within 2-3 cm in diameter. However, RIRS, with less bleeding and shorter postoperative hospital stay, may be an alternative. UROLOGY 115: 65–70, 2018.

technology has been continuously improved in recent years,
especially for PCNL3 and calculi crushing equipment. As
a result, the fragmentation rate for different renal calculi
can achieve more than 85%.3 Nevertheless, PCNL is associated with a variety of severe complications, especially massive hemorrhage, perforation, urine leakage,
infectious fever, urinary sepsis, etc.4 In addition, PCNL is
not suitable for patients with obesity or with coagulation
dysfunction.
Recently, the application of retrograde intrarenal surgery
(RIRS) has been proved to be safe and effective for renal
calculi ≤2 cm in diameter.5 With the accumulation of experience and improvement of flexible ureteroscopic equipment, some urologists applied RIRS for renal calculi >2 cm
in diameter, as an alternative for PCNL.6 To date, there
is no published report that RIRS could be used in renal
calculi in lower calyceal calculi with a diameter of 2-3 cm
in patients with a solitary kidney. A previous study showed
that PCNL remained better for stones >10 mm in the lower
pole compared with lithotripsy.7 Here, we retrospectively
analyzed 76 patients with solitary renal calculi treated at
3 hospitals in China between April 2013 and October 2016.

olitary renal calculi are a common urologic disorder, and frequently multiple, complex, or combined with other diseases. Specifically, renal stone
occurring in lower calyceal is a difficulty in the department of urology. Improper treatment leads to severe complications, including loss of kidney and death.1 With the
rapid development of endoscopic devices and the dramatic advancement in skills of minimally invasive treatment, there are now multiple options. Percutaneous
nephrolithotomy (PCNL) has been the first recommended
therapy for renal calculi with a diameter of ≥2 cm.2 PCNL

METHODS
Patients
This study was a retrospective analysis, and was approved
by the ethics committees of local hospitals. Patients’ medical
records were obtained from the electronic management
systems from the 3 hospitals for patients treated between
April 2013 and October 2016. Patients diagnosed with
single lower calyceal calculi by computed tomography (CT)
were included. The maximum diameter of calculi measured by CT was 2-3 cm. Male or female patients aged 1880 years meeting the inclusion criteria were considered for
enrollment. The exclusion criteria are kidney cancer, ectopic
kidney, sponge kidney, polycystic kidney, pregnancy kidney,
transplant renal calculi, solitary upper calyx calculi, and
uncontrolled purulent kidney. In addition, patients with
surgical contraindications, or a previous extracorporeal shock
wave lithotripsy (ESWL), or a history of urologic surgery
along with PCNL, were excluded. Hence, 76 patients were
divided into the PCNL group and the RIRS group according to the surgical therapy. There were 42 patients in the
PCNL group and 34 in the RIRS group.
Surgical Procedure
Patients in the PCNL group underwent general anesthesia by tracheal intubation and were placed in the lithotomy position. A 6F ureteral catheter was inserted to
the renal pelvis through ureteroscope in the ipsilateral ureter
of the affected side. The puncture was guided by ultrasound and the position was confirmed by x-ray. A 6F ureteral catheter was placed within the cystoscope, and the
bladder was drained with a 16F latex Foley catheter with
double balloon (Weili Medical Equipment Co., Beijing,
China). The balloons were filled with saline to fix them
in position. Then, the prone position was used, and the
renal area was slightly padded up. Saline was injected retrogradely through the 6F ureteral catheter to form the “artificial hydronephrosis.” The target renal calyces of the
patients were punctured by an 18G puncture needle under
the guidance of B-ultrasound, and the safety guide wire was
placed to establish a working channel, then it was expanded to 16F or 18F, to place the disposable tearable
guiding sheath. A nephroscope (wolf F12, Richard Wolf
GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) was placed through the
guiding sheath to be connected to a holmium laser
(VersaPulse PowerSuite 60W, LUMENIS, Haifa, Israel) to
perform lithotripsy. After surgery, a 5F double-J tube and
a 16F nephrostomy tube were retained. The double-J tube
was removed 1 month after surgery, and the nephrostomy
tube could be removed 3-5 days after surgery, if there was
no active bleeding.
Patients in the RIRS group were routinely prestented
2 weeks before surgery using a 6F double-J tube. The patients first underwent examination with a ureteral semirigid endoscope. A 0.035 COOK super-smooth guide wire
was retained, and the endoscope was retraced. Then, a 12
of 14 ureteral dilatation was retrogradely placed along the
guide wire, and an ureteroscope (Flex-x2 F7.5, Karl Storz,
66

Tuttlingen, Germany) was inserted to the renal pelvis
through the sheath. A 200-µm fiber was inserted to perform
lithotripsy, whose power was less than 20 W (0.6-1.0 J or
10-20 Hz). Sodium chloride solution (0.9%) was perfused intraoperatively for manual rinse. The calculi were
crushed into fragments with diameters of 1-2 mm. Residual fragments were removed using a Nition Tipless Stone
Extractor (COOK Medical, Bloomington, IN). After carefully examining each renal calyx to avoid calculus residues, the ureteroscope and the ureteroscopic sheath were
removed, and a 5F double-J tube was conventionally retained, which was removed after 1 month.
Data Collection
The degree of hydronephrosis was evaluated by ultrasound examination of the urinary system according to the
separation degree of the renal pelvis and renal calyx. A separation of renal pelvis and renal calyx of 10-20 mm was mild,
20-30 mm was moderate, and greater than 30 mm was
severe. Patients with renal function insufficiency were evaluated according to the National Kidney Foundation Kidney
Disease Outcome Quality Initiative classification system.8
Patients with normal renal functions received ultrasound
of the urinary system, kidney, ureter, and bladder imaging
plus intravenous urogram, unenhanced CT, and renal
dynamic imaging examination. Patients with insufficient
renal functions received ultrasound of the urinary system,
kidney, ureter, and bladder imaging, CT, and renal dynamic
imaging examination.
Follow-up
All patients underwent blood routine and serum renal function examinations before and after the operation. Postoperative follow-up was performed at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
after surgery. CT examination was performed 1 month after
the operation to confirm the stone clearance status. The
maximum diameter of the residual calculi ≤2 mm was considered to be residual calculi-free. During follow-up, the
patients underwent a urine routine test, a urine culture,
and a B-ultrasound examination of the urinary system every
3 months after surgery. The complications were assessed
according to the Clavien system classification for postoperative complications.9
Outcomes Evaluation
Stone-free rate at 1 session and the overall stone-free rate
of the 2 groups were observed. The 1-session stone-free rate
referred to the stone-free rate after the first session of surgery,
when the calculi were removed thoroughly and the
maximum diameter of residual calculi was ≤2 mm. The final
stone-free rate referred to the final stone free rate at the
last follow-up. The incidence rate of complications, hospital stay, decline of postoperative hemoglobin, and changes
of serum creatinine before and after the operation were observed during the follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
The SPSS 23.0 Chinese version (IBM, Armonk, NY) statistical software was used. Continuous data were expressed

as means ± standard deviation if they met the normal distribution, or median (range) if not normally distributed.
Student t test was used for group comparison. The categorical data were represented by n (%), and the chisquare test or Fisher exact test was used for comparison.
A P <.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

RESULTS
This study included 76 cases of solitary kidney combined
with lower calyceal calculi, including 45 men and 31
women. The age ranged from 18 to 65 years, and the average
age was 39.7 ± 1.5 years. There were 31 cases of anatomically solitary kidney, including 5 cases of congenital solitary kidney; 26 cases of solitary kidney due to contralateral
nephrectomy; 45 cases of functionally solitary kidney, including 14 cases of contralateral renal atrophy; 31 cases of
unilateral renal failure due to diseases; 47 cases of left solitary kidney; and 29 cases of right solitary kidney. Fifteen
cases were combined with mild hydronephrosis, 8 cases were
combined with moderate hydronephrosis, and 15 cases were
combined with renal insufficiency. Serum creatinine was
1.38 ± 0.25 mg/dL (the reference value was 0.45-1.10
mg/dL).
There was no significant difference in age (P = .204), size
of the stone (P = .071), degree of hydronephrosis (P = .904),
renal insufficiency (P = .899), body mass index (P = .407),
and preoperative hemoglobin level (P = .665) (Table 1).
The follow-up was similar (median, PCNL: 12.7 [3-19] vs
RIRS: 12.4 [3-17] months).
The mean operation time of the 2 groups were
82.0 ± 27.9 minutes and 117.2 ± 23.1 minutes, respectively (P <.001). The 1-session stone-free rate of the PCNL

group, using the single tract procedure, was 85.7% (36 of
42), whereas in the RIRS group, the 1-session stone-free
rate was 58.8% (20 of 34) (P = .008). There were 6 cases
with residual calculi in the PCNL group, and there were
3 cases with residual calculi after ESWL and lithotripsy by
changing the position. The total stone clearance rate was
92.9% at the last follow-up.
Moreover, 3 cases developed ureteral obstruction after
removal of the double-J tube at week 2 in RIRS group,
which caused obstructive hydronephrosis, and the calculi
were clearly discharged after emergency surgery. There were
another 17 cases of residual calculi at 1 session in the RIRS
group. Seven of them underwent ESWL and 10 underwent reureteroscopy surgery, but there were still 5 cases with
residual calculi. The overall stone-free rate was 85.3%, and
there was no statistical difference in the overall stonefree rate between the 2 groups (P = .285). The average hospital stay was 13.9 ± 1.6 days and 7.3 ± 1.2 days for PCNL
and RIRS, respectively. The hospital stay in the RIRS group
was shorter than that in the PCNL group (P <.001). Regarding the complications, 4 cases of hemorrhage occurred in the PCNL group, one of which was additionally
treated with selective embolism of the renal artery (his creatinine level was 1.05 mg/dL at last follow-up, ie, 9 months
after surgery). Two of them underwent blood transfusion
and the other one stopped bleeding spontaneously. Postoperative fever and pleural damage happened in the other
7 patients. In the RIRS group, 3 cases had postoperative
fever. No patient suffered from sepsis or renal insufficiency. Three patients in the RIRS group showed steinstrasse
and developed acute obstructive renal failure, and the obstruction was treated with emergency surgery. No steinstrasse
occurred in the PCNL group. No infection or renal failure

occurred in these 3 patients. The changes of serum creatinine before and after the operation were 0.10 ± 0.03 mg/
dL and 0.09 ± 0.04 mg/dL for PCNL and RIRIS, respectively
(P = .264) (Table 2).
The constitution of the calculi was analyzed after the
operation for the 2 groups (Table 3). The results demonstrated that the component of calculi in the PCNL group
and the RIRS group was mainly calcium oxalate calculi,
accounting for 66.7% and 70.6%, respectively. There was
no statistical significance in the constitution of the calculi
between the 2 groups (P = .988) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
PCNL was first reported by Fernström and Johansson10 in
1976, and it is the recommended treatment for renal calculi
≥2 cm. Because the success rate could reach 85%, this
method has been widely applied, but PCNL has a high risk
of complications including massive hemorrhage, perforation, urine leakage, pleural injury, pleural effusion, intestinal injury, infectious fever, and even urinary sepsis.11 Since
the first application of PCNL, percutaneous nephroscope
has been continuously improved. In 1998, Jackman et al12
used the term PCNL for the first time and reported the use
of an 11F channel to perform surgery for children, which
was smaller than the traditionally used 24F-30F channel.
Subsequently, a series of reports suggested the use of PCNL

in adult patients, which achieved high efficacy, and its safety
was recognized.13 Nevertheless, the complications of PCNL
still exist in PCNL. With the continuous development and
progression of urologic endoscopic technology and related
lithotripsy equipment, flexible ureteroscope has the advantages of minimally invasiveness, effectiveness, and safety.
Flexible ureteroscope has curative effect in the treatment
for renal calculi <2 cm, especially for the treatment of lower
calyceal calculi <2 cm, which was recommended by the urologic disease guidelines.14
The treatment of lower calyceal calculi in solitary kidney
is difficult for the treatment of urologic calculi. For patients with renal stone in solitary kidney, serious obstruction, azotemia, disorders in water and electrolyte and acidbase balance, and even acute renal failure might occur. The
currently used treatment methods include ESWL, PCNL,
RIRS, and open surgery. ESWL treatment is relatively simple
and safe, but the stone-free rate is low for calculi >2 cm,
and postoperative steinstrasse could cause acute renal failure.
PCNL remains better for stones >10 mm in the lower pole
compared with lithotripsy.7 Thus, PCNL is a preferred choice
for the treatment of solitary renal calculi. Importantly, the
solitary kidney has been in the compensatory state for a
long term, and has thick cortex, rich blood flow, and abnormal blood vessels, and easily bleeds after puncture and
expansion. Complications, such as peripheral organ injury
and intraoperative and postoperative massive bleeding are

possible, even if PCNL is selected. With the improvement of flexible ureteroscope, urologists began to investigate the efficacy of flexible ureteroscope in the treatment
of renal calculi >2 cm. Akman et al15 performed matchedpair analysis for flexible ureteroscope and PCNL in the treatment of renal calculi of 2-4 cm, and the results showed that
the stone-free rates of flexible ureteroscope and PCNL were
73.5% and 91.2% (P <.05), respectively. After secondary
surgery, the stone-free rate in the flexible ureteroscope group
was 88.2%. The stone-free rate or serious surgical complications was not significantly different between PCNL and
RIRS group. Aboumarzouk et al16 performed meta-analysis
for renal calculi >2.0 cm that were treated by flexible
ureteroscope between 1990 and 2011, and found that the
stone-free rate for 2- to 3-cm calculi was 84.6%, which was
sufficient to be an alternative of PCNL.
To date, there is rare report of PCNL and RIRS in the
treatment of solitary lower calyceal calculi. Therefore,
we retrospectively analyzed the differences of PCNL and
RIRS in the treatment of lower calyceal calculi in solitary kidney to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
PCNL and RIRS in the treatment of lower calyceal calculi
in solitary kidney. In the present study, the stone-free
rate at the first session in the PCNL group was higher
than in the RIRS group, and the operation time was also
shorter than that of the RIRS group. Nevertheless, there
were 4 cases of obvious hemorrhage. For solitary renal
calculi, surgical risk and the possibility of hemorrhage of
PCNL was higher. Compared with PCNL, RIRS cause
smaller tissue damage, but has lower 1-session stone-free
rate. Some patients need a second operation to achieve a
curative effect. Moreover, a spiral stone dislodger was
used in the RIRS group to move the calculi from the
lower calyx to the middle and upper; then holmium laser
lithotripsy was performed, which had a higher efficiency,
and the injury to the patients by the flexible ureteroscope
was smaller. For solitary renal calculi, we recommended
using holmium laser lithotripsy to crush calculi into small
fragments instead of powdering. The calculi were removed
using spiral stone dislodger to avoid forming a steinstrasse
during stone clearance.
It was reported that the risk of infectious fever and sepsis
after RIRS was larger than that of infectious fever after
PCNL.17 There were 3 cases of postoperative fever in the
RIRS group, whereas there were 2 cases of postoperative
fever in the PCNL group. For patients with preoperative
infection, placing a double-J tube for drainage was suggested, followed by flexible ureteroscopy when the infection was controlled. Drainage should be established for
pyuria and infectious calculi, and the operation should be
timely terminated. A secondary operation could be performed when the infection was cured.
Our study indicated that flexible ureteroscopy had good
efficacy and safety for 2- to 3-cm lower calyceal calculi in
solitary kidney. To achieve minimally invasiveness, reduced
bleeding, and rapid recovery, RIRS is an alternative surgical way. Nevertheless, our study has several flaws. For
example, our study was a retrospective analysis with a small
UROLOGY 115, 2018

sample size. Further studies are needed to confirm the comparison of the 2 methods.

CONCLUSION
PCNL group suggested a higher 1-session stone-free rate
for 2- to 3-cm lower calyceal calculi than RIRS group in
solitary kidney. To achieve minimally invasiveness, reduced
bleeding, and shorter hospital stay, RIRS can be a promising alternative. The present study provides preliminary
data that justify such a trial. A multicenter prospective trial
is necessary.

EDITORIAL COMMENT

AUTHOR REPLY

The authors should be commended for a well conducted study
of an important issue to patients and endourologists alike. The
delicate balance lies somewhere between rendering stone-free and
asymptomatic and the exquisite preservation of renal function.
As a result, attempts as the authors have made, to reduce the
risk of bleeding and the potential for an injurious standard tract
percutaneous procedure by dilating to only 16-18 French, achieve
these goals in this study. The case times are expeditious for both
approaches given the stone sizes above 2 cm and with a preponderance of calcium oxalate monohydrate calculi. This latter point
is most important when considering the mode of irrigation employed as the risk of prolonged high pressure irrigation in the solitary kidney is likely underappreciated.
The follow-up is robust and CT documentation of clearance
rates lends credibly to the existent literature. Although the lengths
of hospital stay are long, and not common place in the western
hemisphere, the differences in the health care systems are well
recognized.
Overall, the endourologist must decide whether the risk of renal
puncture exceeds, is equal to, or is less than that of prolonged
ureteroscopic pressurization of the solitary renal unit, and whether
stone-free status is of equal importance as symptom freedom and
metabolic control to prevent growth of any residual fragments.

The treatment of lower calyceal calculi in solitary kidneys is difficult for the treatment of urologic calculi. This study aimed to
explore the safety of 2 different types of surgeries to treat solitary kidney stones. The focus was on increasing the stone-free
rates and maximizing the protection of renal function.
We wanted to reduce the risk of bleeding after puncture and
expansion, using a catheter of only 16-18 French. We achieved
this goal in the study.
The postoperative follow-up was performed using computed tomography to evaluate the stone-free rates of calculi. Although
a great deal of differences were observed between the East and
the West health care systems during the hospital stay, we thank
the editor for understanding these differences.
This study indicated that flexible ureteroscopy had good efficacy and safety for lower calyceal calculi of 2-3 cm in a solitary
kidney. As expressed by us, larger, prospective randomized studies
are necessary to accurately compare the 2 procedures in solitary
kidneys.
All in all, we thank the editor for the comments. We insist
that this study was performed in patients with solitary kidneys,
and that studies in this population are rare. We agree that the
study has limitations and that a multicenter prospective trial is
necessary.
