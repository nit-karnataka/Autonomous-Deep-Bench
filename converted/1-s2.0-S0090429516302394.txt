CONCLUSION

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of wideband Doppler ultrasound-guided mini-endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery (mini-ECIRS) for large renal stones.
This study included 41 patients with large renal stones (>30 mm) treated by mini-ECIRS using
a retrograde flexible ureteroscope and miniature nephroscope by wideband Doppler ultrasound
guidance in the modified Valdivia position from January 2013 to September 2015. Surgical parameters, including the stone-free rate, operative time, complications (especially hemorrhagic complications), and hemoglobin drop were recorded and analyzed. Univariate analysis was performed
to identify risk factors for a hemoglobin drop of ≥1 g/dL.
The mean stone size, including staghorn calculi in 41.4% of cases, was 45.5 ± 14.7 mm. Percutaneous access into the calices using wideband Doppler ultrasound was successful in all cases. The
mean total operative time was 158.4 ± 51.3 minutes. The mean mini-ECIRS time (from first percutaneous puncture to end of procedure) was 106.2 ± 36.0 minutes. The initial stone-free rate was
73.2% (n = 30). The final stone-free rate after auxiliary treatment was 97.5% (n = 40). The mean
hemoglobin drop was 0.54 ± 0.65 g/dL. Three (7.3%) postoperative modified Clavien grade II complications occurred. Univariate analysis revealed no significant risk factors for a hemoglobin drop
of ≥1 g/dL.
Wideband Doppler ultrasound-guided renal puncture is safe and feasible. Wideband Doppler
ultrasound-guided mini-ECIRS is a beneficial, versatile, and safe treatment option for management of large renal stones of >30 mm. UROLOGY 95: 60–66, 2016. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

ercutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) was first introduced as a minimally invasive modality in 1976.
It has since remained the gold standard treatment
for large renal stones of >20 mm.1,2 However, despite the
high stone-free rate (SFR), investigators have reported a
high incidence of complications (20.5%-83.0%).3,4 Bleeding is the most troublesome of these complications and can
occur due to mispuncture of major vessels (such as interlobar arteries), tract creation, renal mucosa laceration due
to stone manipulation, and postoperative pseudoaneurysm

formation.5 In several reports, the perioperative hemoglobin drop after standard PCNL using a ≥ 24F tract was 1.66
to 2.33 g/dL.6-8 However, the risk of bleeding in some novel
techniques, such as minimally invasive PCNL (miniPCNL), ultramini-PCNL, and micro-PCNL, which are characterized by a reduced tract sheath size, is lower than that
in standard PCNL.9,10 In contrast, the decreased size of the
scope and tract sheath increases the operative times for management of large renal stones, resulting in systemic absorption of irrigation fluid due to elevated intrapelvic
pressure in the prone position.10,11 The combination of retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and mini-PCNL, termed
minimally invasive endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery
(mini-ECIRS), recently showed better outcomes than miniPCNL alone for large renal stones of >30 mm.12
To decrease the risk of intraoperative and postoperative renal hemorrhage, the most important process during
PCNL is the establishment of ideal caliceal access for tract
creation. Generally, percutaneous caliceal puncture aims

for the fornix of the target calyx because this area contains fewer blood vessels. However, hemorrhage may occur,
albeit rarely, despite puncture into the fornix of the target
calyx. Recognition of the blood vessel paths within the renal
parenchyma is usually impossible even with fluoroscopic
or B-mode ultrasound guidance. Lu et al5 reported that the
use of color Doppler ultrasound guidance for puncture of
the target calyx allowed for real-time detection and avoidance of renal blood vessels and decreased the incidence of
hemorrhagic complications. However, compared with the
real vessel size, color Doppler and power Doppler ultrasound cause the blood vessels to appear thicker and more
protruding (blooming appearance). Therefore, more sensitive puncture of the target calyx for avoidance of renal
blood vessels such as interlobar arteries is difficult.5,13
Wideband Doppler ultrasound suppresses the blooming appearance and displays a clearer picture of how the blood
vessels run throughout the tissue in real time than do color
Doppler and power Doppler.
In this study, we selected the renal puncture line using
wideband Doppler ultrasound and performed mini-ECIRS
for large renal stones (>30 mm). We evaluated the efficacy and safety of this technique.

concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),
and performance of imaging examinations, such as plain X-rays
of the kidney, ureters, and bladder (KUB); computed tomography; abdominal ultrasonography; and intravenous urography. The
stone size and location were reviewed on the imaging series. The
size of simple stones was measured by the long axis of the stone,
and the size of multiple renal stones was measured by adding the
length of the longest axis of each stone. We routinely administered an antibiotic (flomoxef sodium 1 g) 30 minutes before surgery
in patients with a negative urine culture, and we usually administered an appropriate antibiotic based on the result of the positive urine culture starting the day before surgery. Patients who
were taking an anticoagulation agent withdrew the agent for an
appropriate duration before surgery.
Percutaneous caliceal puncture during the procedure was performed using wideband Doppler ultrasound (Aplio 300 TOSHIBA
Ultrasound System, Japan, or α7 Aloka Ultrasound System, Japan).
Wideband Doppler ultrasound provides a blood flow image with
high resolving power and improved spatial resolution and time
resolution. Wideband Doppler ultrasound suppresses the blooming appearance and displays a clearer image of the path of the
blood vessels in real time than do conventional color Doppler
and power Doppler. Therefore, this method can be used to accurately visualize peripheral vascular flow (Fig. 1A-C).

Operative Technique

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preoperative Evaluation and Settings
We retrospectively analyzed 41 patients in our prospective database who underwent mini-ECIRS using wideband Doppler ultrasound for management of renal stones (>30 mm) from January
2013 to September 2015 at the Department of Urology and Stone
Center, Kansai Medical University Takii Hospital, Osaka, Japan.
Our institutional review board approved this study. All patients
provided written informed consent.
All patients were evaluated preoperatively by obtaining a
medical history and performing a clinical examination, routine
laboratory tests, including measurement of the hemoglobin

All procedures were performed under general anesthesia in the
modified Valdivia position (semi-supine combined lithotomy position), allowing for simultaneous antegrade and retrograde access.
The procedure was performed by 2 surgeons; 1 performed antegrade
mini-PCNL and the other performed RIRS. Mini-PCNL in all
procedures was performed by a single surgeon. First, using a retrograde approach, a semi-rigid ureteroscope was inserted into the
ureter of the diseased side with a 0.035-mm guidewire, and the
lower and middle ureters were observed to confirm the presence
of stones and predict a usable size of ureteral access sheath (UAS).
If no stones were found in the ureter, a UAS of size 9.5/11.5F
(Flexor; Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) or 11/13F (Navigator HD; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) was placed near
the ureteropelvic junction under fluoroscopic guidance. A flexible

ureteroscope (URF-P6; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan, or FLEX-X2; Karl
Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was inserted through the UAS to
confirm the stones in the pelvis and the target calyx for antegrade
puncture. If the UAS could not be inserted near the ureteropelvic junction because of large ureteral stones, RIRS was initially
performed to treat the ureteral stones using a holmium laser.
Second, using an antegrade approach, the target calyx was confirmed using B-mode ultrasound, and the path of the blood vessels
in the same renal parenchyma was confirmed in real time using
wideband Doppler ultrasound. When puncturing the target calyx,
the ultrasound screen was converted to a twin-view image
(Fig. 1D). The target calyx was punctured in 2 steps. An 18gauge coaxial needle was first used to puncture the renal capsule,
and a 22-gauge coaxial needle was then inserted into the outer
cylinder of the 18-gauge coaxial needle and used to puncture the
renal parenchyma until the target calyx was reached. This technique provides the 22-gauge coaxial puncture needle with a stable
axis, which allows for finer puncture of the target calyx. After
successful puncture, an 18F or 19.5F mini-PCNL tract (Karl Storz)
was created under fluoroscopic guidance. A 12F miniature
nephroscope (LithoClast; Boston Scientific Japan, Tokyo, Japan)
and a holmium laser were then used to disintegrate the renal stones.
The fragments were actively flushed out of the collecting system
by irrigation fluid, or extracted using nitinol baskets. Renal stones
that could not be reached by percutaneous procedures were disintegrated using flexible ureteroscopy and laser lithotripsy. The
almost-disintegrated fragments were passed to the percutaneous
tract with flexible ureteroscopy and removed through the percutaneous tract sheath. At the conclusion of the procedure, an
indwelling 6F ureteral stent was placed in the urinary tract, and
a 14F or 16F nephrostomy tube was inserted. If no residual fragments were seen on the image, the nephrostomy tube was clamped
the next day and removed 2 to 3 days after surgery. The ureteral
stent was removed 1 to 2 weeks later.

Postoperative Evaluation and Analysis
The day after surgery, all patients were evaluated by routine laboratory tests including determination of the hemoglobin concentration and eGFR and performance of urinalysis, ultrasonography,
and KUB X-rays. A stone-free status was defined as <4-mm residual fragments on KUB X-rays and ultrasonography at 1 day
and 1 month postoperatively. If ≥5-mm residual fragments were
present on KUB X-rays and ultrasonography 1 day postoperatively, auxiliary treatment was performed 1 week postoperatively. We prospectively recorded the perioperative data and
intraoperative and postoperative complications. In this study, we
defined a hemoglobin drop of ≥1 g/dL as severe bleeding. Univariate analysis was performed to identify risk factors for a hemoglobin drop of ≥1 g/dL. Postoperative complications were graded
according to the modified Clavien classification system. SPSS
version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used to analyze the
collected data. The mean ± standard deviation was calculated,
and Pearson’s chi-square test and the Mann-Whitney U test were
performed as appropriate. Statistical significance was defined as
a P value of <.05.

outcomes are summarized in Table 2. The distance between
the skin and renal capsule, measured ultrasonographically
during percutaneous puncture, was 51.9 ± 21.7 mm. The
mean number of attempts until successful puncture of the
target calyx was 1.8, and most successful punctures were
of the middle calyx (75.6%). All procedures were successfully performed using a single tract with an 18F (73.1%)
or 19.5F (26.9%) tract sheath size and combined RIRS.
The initial SFR was 73.2% (n = 30). Auxiliary treatments were performed in 10 cases of residual stones, including 9 second ECIRS procedures for treatment of 4
complete staghorn calculi, 4 partial staghorn calculi, and
1 non-staghorn calculus, and ureteroscopy for 1 nonstaghorn calculus. As a result, the final SFR was 97.5%
(n = 40). The total operative time (from cystoscopy to the
end of the procedure) was 158.4 ± 51 minutes. The total

complications such as adjacent organ injury, pelvic extravasation, or perirenal urinoma occurred.
Univariate analysis revealed no significant risk factors
for a postoperative hemoglobin drop of ≥1 g/dL (Table 3).

COMMENT
In the present study, wideband Doppler ultrasoundguided mini-ECIRS was a useful and safe procedure for the
management of large renal stones. Although standard PCNL
usually uses a 24F to 30F percutaneous tract sheath, some
investigators recently reported that a larger tract sheath
size is associated with a higher bleeding risk.14 Kukreja et al6
reported that the mean hemoglobin drop associated with
the use of a <22F and >26F tract sheath was 1.1 ± 0.7 g/
dL and 1.66 ± 1.1 g/dL, respectively (P = .002). Yamaguchi
et al15 reported that the incidence of blood transfusion associated with the use of an <18F, 24-26F, 27-30F, and 3234F tract sheath was 1.1%, 4.8%, 5.9%, and 12.1%,
respectively (P < .0001). Therefore, mini-PCNL, which uses
a smaller tract sheath, was introduced to decrease the bleeding risk. Mini-PCNL is performed using a 16F to 20F tract
sheath and a 12F miniature nephroscope. Sabnis et al,16
who performed mini-PCNL through an 18F to 19.5F percutaneous tract sheath for 32 patients with renal stones with
a mean size of 15.2 mm, found that the mean hemoglobin drop was 1.43 ± 1.01 g/dL. Shah et al,10 who performed ultramini-PCNL using a 13F tract sheath for treating
renal stones with a mean size of 26.6 ± 4.7 mm, found that
the mean hemoglobin drop was 1.2 ± 0.3 g/dL. Furthermore, Armagan et al17 performed micro-PCNL using an 8F
tract sheath for treating renal stones with a mean size of
17.9 ± 5.0 mm and found that the mean hemoglobin drop
was 1.1 ± 0.8 g/dL. The advantages of a smaller tract sheath
are less bleeding and fewer hemorrhage complications.
However, a smaller tract sheath, nephroscope, and working
channel increase the operative time and may limit the indication for the procedure with respect to stone size. A
smaller tract sheath may also cause postoperative fever
because of high renal pelvic pressure and possible absorption of microorganisms from the fragmented calculi.10,18 We
performed wideband Doppler ultrasound-guided miniECIRS in the modified Valdivia position to overcome
these disadvantages, diminish the bleeding risk, ensure a
high SFR, and decrease the risk of postoperative urinary
infection.
Percutaneous caliceal puncture during PCNL generally aims for the fornix of the target calyx. However, bleeding may occur despite puncture of this fornix. Therefore,
most investigators have suggested that the best entry
into the desired calyx would be through Brodel’s line. It
is difficult to distinguish this avascular plane using fluoroscopy or B-mode ultrasonography.7 In several studies, the
hemoglobin drop during PCNL by fluoroscopy and

ultrasonography guidance was reportedly 1.10 to 2.16 g/dL
and 1.20 to 2.33 g/dL, respectively.6,8,19 These hemoglobin drops occurred because more bleeding is associated with
a larger tract sheath size. In 1989, McNamara20 first reported the performance of percutaneous procedures using
color Doppler ultrasound mode. Doppler ultrasonography
has a power Doppler mode that displays the magnitude of
vascular flow and a color Doppler mode that displays the
running of vascular flow. These Doppler modes can show
the vascular flow in real time. Using these Doppler modes
for puncture of the target calyx might result in easy detection and avoidance of renal blood vessels such as interlobar arteries and veins and arcuate arteries and veins.
Tzeng et al,7 who performed PCNL through a 30F tract
sheath using B-mode or power Doppler ultrasound guidance, found that the hemoglobin drops associated with each
method were 2.33 ± 0.46 g/dL and 1.47 ± 0.61 g/dL, respectively. Thus, Doppler ultrasonography is a beneficial
method with which to decrease hemorrhagic complications. However, color and power Doppler ultrasound have
some weaknesses. First, the blood vessels shown by these
Doppler modes are thicker than the actual size because of
the blooming appearance. Therefore, it is difficult for some
physicians to identify an accurate puncture line in the renal
parenchyma that will avoid major vessels. Second, when
performing the puncture under color or power Doppler in
real time, the tip of the puncture needle exhibits halation and the puncture needle cannot be seen on the ultrasound screen. To overcome these weak points, we
punctured the target calyx by combining wideband Doppler
and B-mode ultrasound on a twin-view image. Wideband
Doppler ultrasound suppresses the blooming appearance and
clearly displays peripheral blood vessels. Furthermore, the
twin-view image, which shows wideband Doppler ultrasound on 1 screen and B-mode on the other screen, can
avoid halation of the tip of the puncture needle. We also
performed a 2-step puncture to reduce the blur of the tip
64

of the puncture needle, ensuring a delicate puncture. Consequently, the mean hemoglobin drop in the present study
was 0.54 ± 0.65 g/dL, which is lower than in other reports
(Table S1). This method may be 1 option that allows safe
puncture of the target calyx because of the ability to capture
an accurate and objective view of the blood vessel path.
However, if there is a large distance between the skin and
renal capsule on ultrasonography, the path of the blood
vessels within the renal parenchyma can be difficult to
discern because the ultrasonic waves cannot penetrate
deeply enough. In the present study, although the hemoglobin drop tended to increase (≥1 g/dL) when the distance between the skin and renal capsule was >55.2 mm,
likely because the ultrasonic waves could not reach the renal
parenchyma, that distance was not significant.
Although a fluoroscopy- or ultrasound-guided approach for percutaneous renal access is the usual method,
precise percutaneous renal access remains challenging.
Several approaches were recently reported to allow easy
and safe puncture of the renal collecting system. These
methods include 3-dimensional CT guidance, markerbased navigation systems, real-time electromagnetic tracking systems, and electronically instrumented needles.21-24
There is now high expectation for the efficacy of these
methods.
Generally, the first treatment option for large renal stones
may be standard PCNL, which is superior to mini-PCNL.
However, Knoll et al25 reported similar SFRs of 96% and
92% between mini-PCNL and standard PCNL, respectively, for the management of 20-mm renal stones. Pan
et al,26 who performed mini-PCNL for the management of
20- to 30-mm renal stones, reported a high SFR of 96.6%.
Recently, Shah et al10 also found an SFR of 81.8% using
ultramini-PCNL for patients with 20- to 30-mm renal
stones. Even if PCNL is performed using a small tract sheath
for large renal stones (20-30 mm), the SFR is higher.
However, mini-PCNL alone for the management of large

renal stones (>30 mm) has a poor SFR of 38.9%.9 Therefore, although the general indications for mini-PCNL in
adults may include renal stones of <20 or 30 mm in size,
the definite indications for mini-PCNL have not been
clearly defined.11 However, Hamamoto et al12,27 found that
when mini-ECIRS was combined with RIRS and miniPCNL for 30- to 40-mm and >40-mm renal stones, including staghorn stones, better outcomes were obtained,
with a high SFR of 71.4%. The simultaneous approach involving both RIRS and PCNL improves the efficiency of
disintegration and removal of renal stones and increases
the SFR. In the present study, mini-ECIRS was performed for management of large renal stones of 45.5 mm,
and a high SFR of 73.2% was achieved.
We performed mini-ECIRS with the patients in the
modified Valdivia position. This position has some advantages, including a comfortable simultaneous approach for
both RIRS and PCNL, elimination of cardiovascular and
respiratory problems, easy flushing out of small fragments
by the flow of the irrigation fluid, a comfortable sitting position for surgeons during PCNL, and maintenance of lower
renal pelvis pressure because of the horizontal tract sheath,
which reduces the risk of fluid absorption.7,28,29 In the present
study, although the operative time for the management of
large renal stones was relatively long at 158.4 minutes, the
incidence of postoperative fever was low at 7.3%. However,
disadvantages of this modified Valdivia position include constant collapse of the pyelocaliceal system and difficulty maintaining the operative field. Additionally, the performance
of lower-pole puncture is more difficult in this position than
in the prone position because of renal hypermobility to the

Few reports have described the use of wideband Doppler
in clinical practice. In gastroenterological medicine,
wideband Doppler ultrasound has been used for the quantitative evaluation of bowel wall vascularity in patients with
Crohn’s disease and the vascularity of liver tumors, such
as hemangiomas or focal nodular hyperplasia.30,31 To our
knowledge, this is the first report of mini-ECIRS using
wideband Doppler ultrasound in the urological field.
However, a limitation of the study is that it was an experimental case series. Therefore, a prospective randomized control study involving a large number of cases, such
as comparison among B-mode and wideband Doppler, fluoroscopy, and wideband Doppler, is required. Another limitation is that in some cases, the ultrasonic waves could not
penetrate the full distance between the skin and renal
capsule; in these cases, wideband Doppler was not available. Future studies should investigate in which cases
wideband Doppler is available and effective.

CONCLUSION
Wideband Doppler ultrasound-guided renal puncture is safe
and feasible. Wideband Doppler ultrasound-guided miniECIRS is efficient, safe, and versatile for management of
large renal stones of >30 mm.
