Objective: The aim of our study is to compare the effect of ketamine–propofol mixture (ketofol) and
propofol on the laryngeal tube-Suction II (LTS II) insertion conditions and hemodynamics.
Methods: Eighty American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1 and 2 patients were divided into 2 random
groups to receive either 1 mg/kg remifentanil and propofol 2 mg/kg in Group P (n ¼ 40), or 1 mg/kg
remifentanil and ketofol (using a 1:1 single syringe mixture of 5 mg/mL ketamine and 5 mg/mL propofol)
in Group K (n ¼ 40) before induction of anesthesia. After induction, LTS II was inserted. Heart rate and
noninvasive blood pressure were recorded before induction of anesthesia (t0); immediately following
induction (t1); immediately after LTS II insertion (t2); and 3 minutes (t3), 5 minutes (t4), and 10 (t5)
minutes after LTS II insertion. Conditions of insertion of LTS II were assessed and scored 1 to 3 using
6 variables as follows: mouth opening, swallowing, coughing, head and body movements, laryngospasm,
and ease of LTS II insertion by the same experienced anesthesiologist who did not know the agents. LTS II
insertion summed score was prepared depending upon these variables.
Results: In regard to LTS II insertion summed score, Group K was more favorable than Group P (P o
0.05). Apnea duration was longer in Group P (385.0 seconds [range ¼ 195.0–840.0 seconds]) compared
with Group K (325.50 seconds [range ¼ 60.0–840.0 seconds]) but this was not statically signiﬁcant. The
heart rate values were signiﬁcantly lower at all measurement intervals in both groups compared with the
baseline values (P o 0.05). There was no difference in heart rate between Group P and Group K. The
mean arterial pressure values were signiﬁcantly lower at all measurement intervals in Group P compared
with baseline values (P o 0.05). In Group K, the mean arterial pressure values were signiﬁcantly lower
at all measurement intervals compared with the baseline values, except t2 (P o 0.05). There was a
signiﬁcant difference between Group P and Group K in terms of mean arterial pressure at t3 (P o 0.05).
Conclusions: We found that ketofol provided better insertion summed score for LTS II than propofol, with
minimal hemodynamic changes.

Introduction
Propofol is an agent that provides rapid induction and recovery,
depresses airway reﬂexes, and is used for sedation and anesthesia.
The fact that it causes dose-dependent hypotension and respiratory
depression, limits the use of propofol.1,2 If it is used as a single agent

to place laryngeal mask (LMA), it can cause unwanted responses
such as coughing, hiccups, laryngospasm, and movements.3
In addition to its amnesic and analgesic properties, ketamine
increases heart rate and blood pressure by activating the sympathetic nervous system.4 It was observed that a combination of
ketamine and propofol reduced consumption of propofol and
opioids and ensured better hemodynamic and respiratory stability
in patients.5–7
Ketamine and propofol mixture (ketofol) is 5 mg/mL ketamine
and 5 mg/mL propofol, 1:1 mixture in a 20-mL syringe. It is
reported that if ketamine and propofol are mixed in a polypropylene syringe they are physically compatible and chemically stable,
and that they can be stored at room temperature and under light.8

Laryngeal tube-Suction II (LTS II) (VBM, Medizintechnik, Sulz,
Germany) is a double-lumen silicone tube and it is the latest
version of the laryngeal tube (LT), which is a supraglottic airway
device. It is inserted blindly in the upper esophagus and hypopharynx by determining position with the distal tip. LTS II has
2 lumens: 1 for ventilation and the other for the passage of a
gastric tube. It was originally designed for emergency airway
management, including out-of-hospital use, but now it is used
for indications where LMA is used during general anesthesia.13–15
There is no research on the use of ketofol for insertion of LTS II.
The aim of this study is to compare the effect of ketofol and
propofol on LTS II insertion conditions and hemodynamics.

Methods
Following approval of the ethics committee of Inonu University
Faculty of Medicine, Malatya, Turkey (No. 2010/158, January 4,
2011), and provision of written informed consent from the
patients, 80 American Society of Anesthesiologists class 1 and
2 patients, aged between 18 and 65 years, scheduled for elective
surgery that would last o2 hours were included in the study
between January 2011 and November 2011. Patients with
increased aspiration risk, body mass index 4 30, allergy to any
of the agents used in the study, predicted to have difﬁcult airway
(eg, Mallampati score 4 2 or mouth opening o 3 cm), an open eye
injury or other ophthalmologic disorder, psychiatric disease such
as schizophrenia, a history of adverse reaction to ketamine, and
vascular aneurysms were excluded from the study.
The patients were not premedicated. In the operating room
standard anesthetic monitoring was applied with noninvasive
blood pressure, ECG, and peripheric oxygen saturation. After
providing intravenous access, Ringer’s lactate solution infusion
was started. Patients were divided into 2 random groups: a
propofol group (Group P; n ¼ 40) and a ketofol group (Group K;
n ¼ 40) using a computer-generated random number table. All
study medications were prepared in identical 20-mL polypropylene syringes. A 20-mL syringe of propofol 1% (10 mg/mL) was
used for Group P. For Group K, a ketofol solution (total 20 mL) was
prepared, with the agents in the same syringe, using ketamine
100 mg (Ketalar 50 mg/mL; Pﬁzer, New York, NY) and propofol
100 mg (1% propofol; Fresenius, Waltham, MA); the ketofol
syringes contained ketamine 2 mL (100 mg), propofol 1% 10 mL
(100 mg), and saline 8 mL. The concentrations of these drugs were
thus 5 mg/mL ketamine and 5 mg/mL propofol, and there was no
interaction between these drugs in the mixture.
After 3 minutes of preoxygenation, 1 mg/kg remifentanil was
given in 60 seconds. Later, Group P was administered 0.2 mL/kg
propofol and Group K was administered 0.2 mL/kg ketofol (1 mg/kg
ketamine þ 1 mg/kg propofol) approximately in 30 seconds.
If required, further increments of drugs (ketofol or propofol), at
0.05 mL/kg, were given every 30 seconds until loss of consciousness
and loss of eyelash reﬂex. Sixty seconds after induction, LTS II with
deﬂated cuff was inserted by an anesthetist who was unaware of
the agents given, using a water-soluble lubricant per guidelines of
the manufacturer. A size-3 LTS II was used for patients shorter than
155 cm, a size 4 was used for patients between 155 and 180 cm, and
a size 5 was used for patients taller than 180 cm. Cuffs were inﬂated
with the proposed amount of air using the injector proposed by the
manufacturing company. Effective ventilation was conﬁrmed by
capnography and chest expansion. With the cuff manometer (VBM,
Sulz, Germany) maximum pressure was set to 60 cm water and cuff
pressure was measured at certain times during operation. A gastric

tube was inserted along the gastric channel of LTS II and correctness
of the insertion was assessed by aspiration of the gastric ﬂuid and
auscultation of the injected air in the epigastrium.
A maximum of 3 attempts were allowed for the insertion of LTS
II and scoring was done only for the ﬁrst attempt. If LTS II could not
be inserted in the 3 attempts, alternative airway devices were
used. After successful LTS II insertion, anesthesia was maintained
with sevoﬂurane 2%, 60% nitrous oxide, and 40% oxygen. Following
insertion of LTS II, patients were ventilated manually until spontaneous respiration returned and this period was recorded as apnea
time. Patients were ventilated with the synchronized intermittent
mandatory ventilation mode until end of the operation.
Conditions of insertion of LTS II were assessed using 6 variables:
mouth opening (1 ¼ full, 2 ¼ partial, and 3 ¼ nil), gagging or
coughing (1 ¼ nil, 2 ¼ slight, and 3 ¼ gross), swallowing (1 ¼ nil,
2 ¼ slight, and 3 ¼ gross), head or limb movements (1 ¼ nil, 2 ¼
slight, and 3 ¼ gross), laryngospasm (1 ¼ nil, 2 ¼ partial, and
3 ¼ complete), and ease of laryngeal tube insertion (1 ¼ easy, 2 ¼
difﬁcult, and 3 ¼ impossible). The insertion condition summed
score for LTS II insertion was calculated by summing the insertion
score for each patient and then totaling the score for all patients in
the groups. Insertion time was recorded from the time of removal
of the facemask to delivery of the ﬁrst breath through the assigned
airway device.
Systolic arterial pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart
rate (HR), and peripheric oxygen saturation were measured before
anesthesia induction (t0); immediately after induction (t1); immediately after insertion of LTS II (t2); and 3 minutes (t3), 5 minutes
(t4), and 10 minutes (t5) after insertion of LTS II. The incidence of
adverse events during anesthesia such as laryngospasm, bronchospasm, excessive secretion, hallucination, bradycardia, muscular
rigidity, nausea, and vomiting were recorded.
At the end of the operation, LTS II was removed by deﬂating the
cuff when patients were in deep anesthesia and had sufﬁcient
spontaneous respiration (tidal volume 4 5 mL/kg, number of
breaths 4 12 breaths/min). After patients were taken to recovery
unit, nausea, vomiting, hallucination, sore throat, hoarseness, and
dysphagia were monitored within postoperative period of 1 to
24 hours.
A power analysis suggested a minimum 39 patients in each
group with a mean (SD) change of 8 (13) mm Hg in MAP in Group
P, and 8 (12) mm Hg in Group K (α ¼ 0.05 and β ¼ 0.20 [0.80
power]). We included 40 patients in both groups in the study. The
SPSS version 16 software package (IBM SPSS Inc, Armonk, New
York) was used in evaluation of the data. Normality of the
distribution within the groups was measured by Shapiro-Wilk
test. Differences between the groups were assessed by independent samples t test and Mann-Whitney U test. Repeating measurements of analysis of variance was performed in the comparison of
the hemodynamic data within each group based on our hypothesis, and then Bonferroni test was carried out for multiple
comparisons. Conditions of the insertion of LTS II were evaluated
by Fisher exact χ2 test. Yates’ corrected χ2 test was used for ease of
insertion of the laryngeal tube. P o 0.05 was considered to be
statically signiﬁcant.

Results
There were no differences in the demographic data of the
groups (Table I).
Median (minimum-maximum) LTS II insertion time was similar
for Group K (13.50 [8.0-45.0] seconds) and Group P (20.0 [8.0-90.0]
seconds). Apnea duration was longer in Group P (385.0 [195.0840.0] seconds) compared with Group K (325.50 [60.0-840.0]
seconds), but this was not statically signiﬁcant (Table I).

Number of attempts needed to insert LTS II, successful insertions, and correct position of LTS II was similar among the groups.
However, when considering the LTS II insertion conditions
summed scores, Group K was favourable compared with Group P
(P o 0.05) (Table II).
The HR values were signiﬁcantly lower at all measurement
intervals in both groups compared with the baseline values (P o
0.05). There was no difference in HR between Group P and Group K
(Figure 1).
The MAP values were signiﬁcantly lower at all measurement
intervals in Group P compared with the baseline values (P o 0.05).
In Group K, the MAP values were signiﬁcantly lower at all
measurement intervals compared with the baseline values except
at t2 (P o 0.05).
There was a signiﬁcant difference between Group P and Group
K in terms of MAP values at t3 (P o 0.05) (Figure 2).
Adverse effects such as excessive secretion, hallucination,
bradycardia, or muscular rigidity was not observed in any patients.
Nausea and vomiting were seen in 2 patients in Group P and
3 patients in Group K. Within the ﬁrst 24 hours, sore throat was
observed in 8 patients in Group P and 6 patients in Group K.

Discussion
In our study LTS II insertion condition summed score was better in
the Group K compared with the Group P, and the hemodynamic
changes were similar between the groups except for MAP values at t3.
LTS II is a supraglottic airway device used for spontaneous or
controlled ventilation during general anesthesia.16 Success ratio,
leakage pressure, number of times the position of the device was
corrected, and ratio of insertion of the gastric tube were found to
be similar in previous studies that compare LTS and LMA.17–19
Propofol is an induction agent used frequently to insert LT. Burlacu
et al20 reported that the insertion of LT and LMA requires similar
doses of propofol.
Sufﬁcient anesthetic deepness and mouth openness is needed
for correct insertion of supraglottic airway devices and prevent
such complications as coughing, hiccups, swallowing, head, and
extremity movements and laryngospasm.20,21 When propofol is
used alone it cannot provide LMA insertion conditions, or highdose propofol is needed to improve the insertion conditions. On
the other hand, high doses of propofol cause cardiorespiratory
depression.21,23 Addition of lidocaine, opioids, ketamine, or myorelaxants to propofol reduced the dose of propofol used and
increased the success ratio of LMA insertion.22–24 Bein et al14
administered 2 mg/kg propofol and 0.1 mg/kg remifentanil for LTS
insertion in the their study and reported that the success ratio was
100%. Likewise, in our study, success ratio of LTS II insertion was
100% in Group P. Goh et al24 reported success rate was 86.7% when
ketamine was added to propofol. We found our LTS II insertion
success ratio to be 97.5% in Group K. We think use of both
ketamine and remifentanil in Group K was effective in this result.
Ketamine increases heart rate and arterial blood pressure by
activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Clinical effects of
propofol and ketamine seem to be complementary. When propofol
and ketamine are administered in combination, doses of both
agents decrease and unwanted effects are minimized.25 It was
shown in studies of adult and pediatric patients that ketamine
applied before propofol induction for LMA insertion preserved
hemodynamic stability.24,26,27 Erdogan et al28 reported that ketofol
provided Proseal LMA insertion conditions similar to those for
propofol with a decreased ephedrine requirement in elderly
patients. In our study, MAP maintained a higher level in Group K
compared with Group P at all measurement times; however, this
reached a statistically signiﬁcant level at 3 minutes after insertion
of LTS II.
Tosun et al29 reported that hemodynamic parameters were
similar in both groups when 1 mg/kg ketamine or 1 mg/kg fentanil
was added to propofol for sedation in children with burns. Likewise, in a study by Erden et al30 propofol-fentanil and propofolfentanil-ketamine combinations provided similar hemodynamic
stability in children. However, in our study hemodynamic stability

was not maintained because we used a higher dose of propofol
than was used in the previous study. Iwata et al31 could not
achieve hemodynamic stability with 0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg ketamine applied before 2 mg/kg propofol for anesthetic induction in
the double-lumen tube application. Those authors pointed out that
this might be due to use of fentanil and sevoﬂurane in both groups.
Similarly, use of remifentanil before induction may have impaired
the hemodynamic effects of ketofol in our study.
Akın et al32 showed that addition of ketamine to propofol
protected respiration better than use of propofol alone for the
purpose of sedation of children. Its depressive effect on the central
respiratory system is minimal and it preserves response to carbon
dioxide.33 In our study, apnea time was shorter in Group K than
Group P, although the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.
Concerns regarding ketamine are increased secretion, delay of
recovery, and emergence of reactions.34 We did not see these
adverse effects in our study. Those adverse effects might be
reduced by the presence of propofol.

Conclusions
In our study LTS II insertion condition summed score was better
in Group K compared with Group P with minimal the hemodynamic changes. When these parameters are considered, ketofol
might be used as an alternative to propofol for LTS II insertion in
adults.

There are some limitations to our study. First, we were unable
to measure anesthetic depth, so LTS II insertion conditions may
have been adversely affected and changes may have been observed
in hemodynamic parameters. Second, use of remifentanil in both
groups before induction may have impaired the hemodynamic
effects of the agents.
