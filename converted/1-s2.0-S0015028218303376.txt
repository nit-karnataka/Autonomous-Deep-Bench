Endometritis is subdivided into two categories. Acute endometritis is symptomatic and characterized by microabscess formation and
neutrophil invasion in the endometrial superﬁcial epithelium, gland lumina, and uterine cavity. Chronic endometritis is rather silent
and recognized as unusual plasmacyte inﬁltration in the endometrial stromal areas. Over the last decade, studies have disclosed the
potential association between poor reproductive outcomes and endometritis, particularly chronic endometritis. The aim of this review
is to address the current literature surrounding chronic endometritis and highlight recent advances in the research of this long-neglected
gynecologic disease. (Fertil SterilÒ 2018;110:344–50. Ó2018 by American Society for Reproductive Medicine.)

nder physiological conditions,
human cycling endometrium
is inﬁltrated by a wide variety
of immunocompetent cells, including
macrophages, natural killer cells, and
T lymphocyte subsets. The composition
and density of endometrial immunocompetent cells vary periodically
across the menstrual cycle. Such timed
ﬂuctuation in local leukocyte subpopulations is thought to play a role in the
tissue remodeling required to obtain
endometrial receptivity (1).
Endometritis is an infectious and
inﬂammatory disorder of the endometrium. Endometritis is histopathologically subdivided into two categories
(2). One is acute endometritis, which is
characterized by microabscess formation and neutrophil invasion in the
endometrial superﬁcial epithelium,
gland lumina, and uterine cavity. The
results of randomized controlled trials
have demonstrated that acute endometritis is not associated with reduced

pregnancy or elevated infertility (3).
The other is chronic endometritis (CE),
the histopathologic features of which
are endometrial superﬁcial edematous
change, high stromal cell density, dissociated maturation between epithelium
and stroma, and inﬁltration of endometrial stromal plasmacytes (ESPCs) (2, 4).
There are currently no universally
accepted standardized deﬁnitions or
established diagnostic guidelines for
CE, although experts agree that the
presence of multiple ESPCs is the most
speciﬁc and sensitive ﬁnding in this
pathology (5–7).
In sharp contrast to acute endometritis being manifested with fever, pelvic pain, and vaginal discharge, the
subtle and nondescript symptoms (pelvic discomfort, spotting, and leucorrhea) of CE are often unnoticed by
patients and ignored by gynecologists
(5). As a benign disease, interventional
endometrial biopsy and arduous histopathologic examinations for CE are

not favored in gynecologic practice.
Accurate histopathologic diagnosis of
CE has been demanding and timeconsuming until recently (5). Increasing
attention, however, has been focused
on the potential association between
poor reproductive outcomes and CE.
Here we aim to address the current
literature surrounding CE and highlight
recent advances in research of this
long-neglected gynecologic disease.
The following databases were searched
for articles regarding CE until February
2018: PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect,
Wiley-Blackwell, Lippincott Williams
& Wilkins, Highwire, and Google
Scholar. Each database was searched
using the following terms: ‘‘endometritis’’, ‘‘deciduitis’’, ‘‘subclinical pelvic
inﬂammatory diseases’’, and ‘‘upper female tract infection’’.

MICROORGANISMS IN
CHRONIC ENDOMETRITIS
The major cause of CE is microbial
infection in the uterine cavity. This is
supported by the fact that some antibiotic therapies are effective to eliminate ESPCs in the affected patients
(8–12). The microorganisms detected
frequently in endometrium with CE
are common bacteria (streptococcus

species, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and
staphylococcus species), mycoplasma/ureaplasma species
(Mycoplasma
genitalium,
Mycoplasma
hominis,
and Ureaplasma urealyticum), proteus species, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Gardnerella vaginalis,
Corynebacterium, and yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
candida species) (13–15). In some developing countries,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a microorganism causing
chronic granulomatous endometritis, a subtype of CE
characterized by poorly developed caseating granuloma and
surrounding lymphocyte inﬁltrates including ESPCs (16).
By contrast, accumulating studies found that the detection rate of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the principal pathogens causing acute endometritis,
are very low in patients with CE (2%–7% and 0%–8%, respectively) (13, 17, 18). Moreover, administration of azithromycin
or ceﬁxime, the antibiotics targeting C. trachomatis and N.
gonorrhoeae, failed to preserve future fertility in women
with CE (19). C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae are thereby
unlikely to be the major pathogens in CE. Although their
cause-effect relationship remains undetermined, such differences in the microbial proﬁles suggest that acute endometritis
and CE are distinct pathologic entities (20).
Altered proportion in anaerobic lactobacilli species, the predominant bacteria in the female reproductive tracts (21–24),
may be another characteristic of CE, although the results are
conﬂicting between the studies. While the report employing
conventional tissue culture showed a lower detection rate of
lactobacilli in the endometrium of infertile women with CE
than in those without CE, the others using barcoded
sequencing demonstrated an increase of local lactobacilli in
CE (15, 25). Further studies are required to conﬁrm the
change of lactobacilli species in the uterine cavity in CE.
A few reports implicate human immunodeﬁciency virus
(26, 27) and cytomegalovirus (28) in CE. The association
between these viral infections and CE remains uncertain.
Importantly, the microorganisms detected in the endometrial tissue are often inconsistent with those detected in the
endocervical tissue or vaginal discharge (14), suggesting
that the microbial examinations using lower genital tract
samples cannot predict the pathogens of CE. In addition,
endometrial tissue culture and conventional polymerase
chain reaction were unable to identify microorganisms in
more than half of infertile women with CE (15). These ﬁndings
indicate the limitation of the traditional microbial examinations in the diagnosis of CE.

INFLAMMATION IN CHRONIC ENDOMETRITIS
B lymphocytes account for only less than 1% of entire leukocyte population in the nonpathological human endometrium.
Endometrial B cells are mainly seen in the basal layer (the
portion that persists across the menstrual cycle) as central
cells in the unique lymphocyte aggregates surrounded by
numerous CD8(þ) T cells and macrophages (29). The role of
B cells and lymphocyte aggregates in the human endometrium remains open to debate. In contrast, in CE, a large number of B cells inﬁltrate both the endometrial functional layer
(the portion shed with the onset of menstruation) and the

basal layer. These overpopulated B cells amass in the endometrial stromal compartment, trespass on the glandular epithelial areas, and invade further into the gland lumina (30, 31).
Additionally, the secretory phase endometrium with CE was
reported to contain a lower percentage of CD16negative
CD56positive/bright natural killer cells compared with those
without CE, along with an increase in T cells, indicating the
aberrant mucosal leukocyte composition in this pathologic
condition (32).
Several adhesion molecules and chemokines involved in
B cell extravasation and migration (CD62E, CXCL1, and
CXCL13) are aberrantly expressed in endometrial endothelial
and epithelial cells with CE (31). The concentration of interleukin (IL)-6, a differentiation factor of mature B cells, is
also markedly higher in the menstrual efﬂuents of women
with CE compared with those without CE (33). In vitro studies
demonstrated that these proinﬂammatory molecules are
induced in endometrial cells by microbial antigens such as
lipopolysaccharide (31). These ﬁndings suggest that microbial
infection in the uterine cavity triggers the immune responses
unusual to human cycling endometrium. Such immune responses provide an abnormal microenvironment for the
recruitment of circulating B cells into the endometrial stromal
compartment and gravitation of these lymphocytes to the
glandular areas. Furthermore, a fraction of accrued endometrial B cells may differentiate in situ into ESPCs.
Similar to other chronic inﬂammatory diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and inﬂammatory bowel disease, the levels of
IL-1b and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a are also elevated in
the uterine cavity of CE (33). Exposure to TNF-a is known
to raise estrogen biosynthesis in endometrial glandular cells
(34), which may be associated with the occurrence of endometrial micropolyposis, a hysteroscopic ﬁnding that is often seen
in CE (see below) (9, 35).
The ESPCs in CE legions express a high level of multiple
immunoglobulin (Ig) subclasses (IgM, IgA1, IgA2, IgG1, and
IgG2) with a predominance of IgG2 (36). The excessive
mucosal antibodies in CE potentially have a negative impact
on the embryo implantation process. These local immune responses in CE rarely develop into systemic inﬂammation, as
the values of the peripheral blood leukocyte counts, serum
C-reactive protein, and fever index of the affected patients
stay within the normal ranges (37, 38).
One of the histomorphological characteristics of CE is
delayed differentiation of endometrium in the midsecretory
phase. Approximately one-third of the endometrial samples
with CE obtained from infertile women exhibit such
‘‘out-of-phase’’ morphology (37). The endometrium with CE
obtained in the secretory phase often displays pseudostratiﬁcation and mitotic nuclei in both glandular and surface
epithelial cells. The expression of the antiapoptotic genes
(BCL2 and BAX), proliferation-associated nuclear marker
(Ki-67), and ovarian steroid receptors (estrogen receptor-a,
and -b, progesterone receptor-A, and -B) are also upregulated
during the secretory phase in the endometrium with CE
(39–42). By contrast, the expression of the genes potentially
associated with embryo receptivity (IL11, CCL4, IGF1,
and CASP8) and decidualization (PRL and IGFBP1) are
downregulated in the endometrium with CE during this

period (39, 42). These ﬁndings support the idea that the
endometrium with CE is unable to respond to ovarian
steroids and modulate its component cells into a receptive
phenotype, implicating the potential relationship between
progesterone resistance and CE, as seen in endometriosis (43).

DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC ENDOMETRITIS
Symptomatology does not seem to help gynecologists diagnose CE, as a quarter of the affected patients lack symptoms
(37). The above mentioned microbial examinations and blood
tests are not instrumental. Thus, histopathologic detection of
multiple ESPCs in endometrial biopsy is of primary importance in the diagnosis of CE in current clinical practice.
Be that as it may, identiﬁcation of ESPCs by conventional
tissue staining alone is not easy even for experienced pathologists. Plasmacytes typically have a large cell body, high
nuclei/cytoplasm ratio, basophilic cytoplasm, and nuclei
with heterochromatin rearrangement referred as the ‘‘spokewheel’’ or ‘‘clock-face’’ pattern (44). These morphological features of plasmacytes are not always evident in ESPCs under
microscopic examination, as ESPCs often exhibit an appearance similar to stromal ﬁbroblasts and mononuclear leukocytes that reside in the human endometrium. Some
histological ﬁndings common in the secretory phase endometrium such as superﬁcial edematous change and elevated stromal cell density may also interfere with the identiﬁcation of
ESPCs (45). Identiﬁcation of glandular-stromal dyssynchrony
and endometrial eosinophil inﬁltrates (cytoplasmic eosinophilic granules) on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining
sections was proposed as a convenient screening tool to
discover ESPCs but are not the absolute ﬁndings in CE (46).
Histopathologic evaluation using immunohistochemistry
for plasmacyte marker CD138 (also known as syndecan-1, a
transmembrane-type heparan sulfate proteoglycan) is
currently the most reliable and time-saving diagnostic
method for CE (47). It was shown that CD138 immunostaining
is greatly superior in the detection of ESPCs to conventional
tissue staining using methyl green pyronin, hematoxylin,
and eosin (odds ratio, 2.8; sensitivity, 100% vs. 75%; speciﬁcity, 100% vs. 65%) with less interobserver (96% vs. 68%)
and intraobserver variability (93% vs. 47%) (48–50).
Despite the usefulness of CD138 immunostaining in the
diagnosis of CE, some caution should be exercised in its practical use and interpretation of results. Endometrial epithelial
cells are known to constitutively express CD138 on the basolateral sides of their plasma membrane. Many of monoclonal
antibodies targeting CD138 on plasmacytes are also reactive
to the epitope of this antigen expressed on endometrial epithelial cells, despite that staining intensity is generally weaker
than that in ESPCs (51). The conditions of the sections and
immunoreactivity may occasionally cause misidentiﬁcation
of endometrial epithelial cells for ESPCs, resulting in potential
overdiagnosis of CE. Combined use of immunohistochemistry
and conventional nucleic staining is a recommended option to
avoid this kind of misinterpretation.
There are currently no technical standards or conditions
setting regarding CD138 immunostaining for endometrial
specimens, suggesting that the diagnostic rates of CE are

potentially affected by laboratory test setting and quality
control including antibody selection and dilution, incubation
time, thickness of endometrial sections, and number and area
of sections examined (52). This problem is illustrated by a
comparison of several published studies that scored inconsistent detection rates of ESPCs in cohorts of infertile women.
For example, one study using a 1:1,000 dilution of clone
B-B4, one of representative anti-CD138 monoclonal antibodies, showed that the prevalence of CE was 2.8% in asymptomatic infertile women undergoing their ﬁrst IVF-ET cycle
(52). Meanwhile, other studies using a higher concentration
of anti-CD138 antibodies (1:100 dilution of B-B4 or stock solution of another frequently used clone B-A38) identiﬁed CE
in 12%–30% of infertile patients (8, 31, 53, 54). Accordingly,
the standardized test setting and quality control for CD138
immunostaining are indispensable to minimize the
discrepancies in the diagnosis of CE.
The timing and method of endometrial sampling are also
a major issue for accurate assessment of CE. ESPCs may be
missed in small biopsy specimens, as these lymphoid cells
often gather focally within the endometrial stroma (4, 45).
In some cases of CE, ESPCs are identiﬁable only in the
endometrial basal layer. A study using full-thickness endometrium of patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign pelvic diseases demonstrated that overlooking of ESPCs can
occur more frequently in the endometrial samples obtained
from surface layers during the secretory phase compared
with the proliferative phase (37). Indeed, several studies
showed a higher prevalence of CE in the proliferative phase
than in the secretory phase (46, 55–57). Examiners should
be aware of the date in the menstrual cycle and the volume
of the endometrial biopsy specimens for the exact diagnosis
of CE.
Finally, stringent criteria have not yet been established
for the evaluation of the ESPC density in the endometrial biopsy specimen. Although the presence of multiple (two or
more) ESPCs is a sine qua non for the conﬁrmation of CE,
there are some biases and variances in deﬁnitions of CE
among the studies. While one study diagnosed CE with
more than ﬁve CD138(þ) ESPCs in at least one out of three
sections levels in the endometrial biopsy specimens (47),
others set the values for CE as one or more CD138(þ) ESPCs
in one microscopic high-power ﬁeld (8). Another issue is
that the endometrium of the healthy women may potentially
contain some (even if only a few) ESPCs. It is crucial to redeﬁne the minimum volumes of the endometrial samples evaluated and the cutoff density of ESPCs that is required for
histopathologic diagnosis of CE.
Hysteroscopy has the potential to be a screening tool for
CE. The representative hysteroscopic ﬁndings seen in CE are
endometrial micropolyposis and strawberry aspects. Endometrial micropolyposis is recognized as multiple small-sized
(typically 1–2 mm in diameter) protrusions arising from the
endometrial surface. Endometrial micropolyposis was found
in 11% of women undergoing hysteroscopy and associated
with endometrial stromal edema and thickening (35). Endometrial micropolyposis is identiﬁable in 50%–67% of infertile
women undergoing repeated implantation failure (RIF) and/or
recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) with immunohistochemically/

histopathologically conﬁrmed CE (9, 57, 58). The etiological
relationship between endometrial micropolyposis and CE
remains yet to be elucidated. Meanwhile, strawberry aspects
are characterized by the presence of the hyperemic
endometrial areas ﬂushed with a white central point (59).
Strawberry aspects were found in 65% of women with
immunohistochemically/histopathologically conﬁrmed CE
(60). There is a good positive correlation (16%–54% in
sensitivity and 60%–94% in speciﬁcity) between these
unique hysteroscopy ﬁndings and CE, although the studies
so far suggest that hysteroscopy cannot replace the
histopathologic examinations using CD138 immunostaining
in the diagnosis of CE (9, 19, 60–62).

REPRODUCTIVE FAILURE AND CHRONIC
ENDOMETRITIS
The reported prevalence of CE in premenopausal women
ranges from 8% to 72% (5, 61). This interstudy variance is,
at least in part, due to the facts that CE was investigated in
a relatively small cohort (less than 100) of patients and that
the conventional tissue staining was used for detection of
ESPCs. Recent published data using CD138 immunostaining
estimated that the overall prevalence of CE in 1,551
premenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy and
endometrial biopsy was 24.4% (57).
Several risk factors have been proposed in regard to the
onset of CE. Among them is continuous use of intrauterine
contraceptive devices, which is characterized by prolonged
ESPC accumulation even after their removal from the uterine
cavity (37, 62). Multiparity, abortion, prolonged menstruation,
atypical uterine bleeding, and fallopian tube obstruction
are also suggested to be the independent risk factors for
CE, whereas age, obesity, oral contraceptive use, and
multigravidity are unlikely (37, 62–64). Bacterial vaginosis,
endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, submucosal ﬁbroids,
tuberculosis, and endometrial osseous metaplasia were also
reported to be associated with CE (37, 65–70).
A growing body of evidence suggests a link between CE
and infertility. CE is diagnosed in 28% of infertile patients
with unknown etiology, 14%–41% of patients with RIF, and
8%–28% of patients with RPL (9–11, 37, 54, 57, 71). The
infertile CE women with a history of RIF have a signiﬁcantly
lower implantation rate in the IVF-ET cycle after endometrial
biopsy than those with RIF but without CE (15% vs. 46%) (8).
Likewise, the per-pregnancy live birth rate in women with a
history of RPL and untreated CE is very poor (7%) (10).
Furthermore, women of reproductive age who contracted CE
were at 60% higher risk of future infertility compared with
the non-CE cohort (19).
Diffuse and extensive plasmacyte inﬁltration is occasionally found in the basal plate of the placenta of women undergoing obstetric complications, which is denoted as chronic
deciduitis (72). Chronic deciduitis was reported to be linked
to preterm labor (41%) (72, 73) and neonatal periventricular
leukomalacia/cerebral palsy (20%) (74). Intriguingly, chronic
deciduitis is seen more frequently in IVF-ET pregnancies resulting from donor eggs (2.8%–42%) compared with those
from autologous eggs (1.6%–1.8%), suggesting that chronic

deciduitis may represent chronic semiallograft rejection by
the maternal immune system of the conceptus (75–77). The
expression level of several proinﬂammatory genes (IGJ,
IGLL1, CXCL13, CD27, CXCL9, CXCL10, ICOS, and KLRC1)
is increased in the placenta with chronic deciduitis
compared with in the placenta without inﬂammation
(72, 78, 79). Overexpression of IgJ chain in chronic
deciduitis seems to be attributable to placental inﬁltration
of IgM and/or IgG-bearing PCs and immature B cells. An
epidemiologic study supports the idea that chronic deciduitis
originates in preconceptional CE rather than in ascending
infection during the gestational period (74).

TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC ENDOMETRITIS
Accumulating evidence indicates the effectiveness of the oral
antibiotic treatment to eliminate ESPCs in CE. A few studies
reported that some progestogens (such as megestrol acetate)
are another treatment option for CE, but the data are insufﬁcient to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety (48).
Based upon its broad antibacterial spectrum covering
from common bacteria to mycoplasma, doxycycline has
been used as a treatment of CE (3). Johnston-MacAnanny
et al. prescribed oral doxycycline (200 mg per day for
14 days) in CE patients with a history of RIF, which resulted
in the clearance of CD138(þ) ESPC in 70% (7/10) of the second endometrial biopsy specimens in these women. An additional treatment with a combination of ciproﬂoxacin and
metronidazole (500 mg of each per day for 14 days) was effective to eliminate ESPCs in the remaining three patients resistant to doxycycline (8). Using the same antibiotic regimen, we
prospectively investigated the effectiveness in a larger cohort
of CE patients with a history of RIF (15). Oral doxycycline
(200 mg per day for 14 days) alone eradicated CD138(þ)
ESPC in 92.3% (108/117) of CE patients and lowered the
detection rate of some pathogenic microorganisms including
corynebacterium, enterococcus, E. coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, U. urealyticum, and Ureaplasma parvum in the endometrium of these women, while increasing the detection rate of
lactobacillus species. Moreover, the overall cure rate of CE
was 99.1% (116/117 patients) following second-line treatment with metronidazole (500 mg per day for 14 days)/ciproﬂoxacin (400 mg per day for 14 days) for patients resistant to
doxycycline.
According to the results of the endometrial microbial examinations, Cicinelli et al. classiﬁed the antibiotic regimens
for the treatment of CE women with a history of RIF (11). Ciproﬂoxacin (1,000 mg per day for 10 days) was used for most
patients who were positive for Gram-negative bacteria,
whereas a combination of amoxicillin/clavulanate (2 g per
day for 8 days) was given to those with Gram-positive bacteria. The patients with mycoplasm and/or ureaplasm species
were treated with josamycin (2 g per day for 12 days) along
with minocycline (200 mg per day for 12 days) as the
second-line regimen. The patients with negative endometrial
microbial examinations were administered a combination of
ceftriaxone (250 mg, single dose, IM injection), doxycycline
(200 mg per day for 14 days), and metronidazole (1,000 mg
per day for 14 days). In this retrospective study, 28% (17/

61) of the patients overcame CE with a single course of antibiotic regimen, whereas 23% (14/61) and 25% (15/61)
required the second course and the third course of antibiotic
treatment, respectively. The remaining 25% (15/61) were
resistant to three-time repetition of the same regimen.
McQueen et al. (10) treated infertile CE women with a history of early RPL and/or fetal demise. The ﬁrst-line combination of oﬂoxacin (800 mg per day for 14 days) and
metronidazole (1,000 mg per day for 14 days) was effective
for 73% (19/26) of patients. All of the remaining nine patients
resistant to this combination were cured with the second-line
regimens using doxycycline alone, doxycycline and metronidazole, or metronidazole and ciproﬂoxacin.
For infertile women with chronic granulomatous endometritis, antitubercular chemotherapy including isoniazid
(300 mg per day), rifampicin (450–600 mg per day), ethambutol (800–1,200 mg per day), and pyrazinamide (1,200–
1,500 mg per day) was shown to be effective (69).

PREGNANCY OUTCOME AFTER ANTIBIOTIC
TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC ENDOMETRITIS
Some studies suggest that oral antibiotic treatment potentially improves the pregnancy outcome in infertile women
with CE.
In their retrospective analysis, Cicinelli et al. investigated
pregnancy outcomes after antibiotic treatment in CE patients
with a history of RIF (11). In the subsequent fresh day 3 ET cycle, the live birth rate (60.9%, 28/46 vs. 13.3%, 2/15) was
higher in the cured CE group than in the persistent CE group.
No difference was found in the live birth rate between the patients undergoing single course antibiotic treatment and those
undergoing multiple course antibiotic treatment. Cicinelli
et al. recently reported similar results in 95 infertile CE women
with unexplained etiology (71). The cumulative live birth rate
per patient after spontaneous conception in the course of a12month follow-up was higher in the cured CE group (65.8%,
25/38) than in the persistent CE group (6.6%, 1/15) and
non-CE group (4.8%, 2/42).
In a before and after study, McQueen et al. showed that
antibiotic treatment increased the per-pregnancy live birth
rate in CE women with a history of RPL (7% [7/98] before
vs. 56% [28/50] after treatment). The cumulative live birth
rate in the RPL/cured CE group was 88% (21/24), whereas
that in the RPL/non-CE group was 74% (180/244) (12).
We prospectively followed up the pregnancy outcome in
118 CE women with a history of RIF undergoing antibiotic
treatment (15). All of the patients had the subsequent fresh
or cryopreserved-thawed cleavage-stage embryo/blastocyst
transfer cycle after the second endometrial biopsy to
conﬁrm the clearance of ESPCs. The live birth rate per patient in the cured CE group after antibiotic treatment was
32.8% (38/116) in the ﬁrst ET cycle and 38.8% (45/116) in
three cumulative ET cycles, whereas one patient with persistent CE failed to conceive. The effect of the antibiotic treatment was notable in the cryopreserved-thawed blastocyst
transfer cycles (15). The live birth rate in the cured CE group
was higher than that in the RIF/non-CE group (22.1%, 50/
226 in the ﬁrst ET cycle and 27.9%, 63/226 in the cumula-

tive three ET cycles), suggesting that the effectiveness of the
antibiotic treatment for CE is independent of endometrial
scratching effect (80).
In infertile women with tuberculosis-associated CE, antitubercular chemotherapy based on a positive endometrial
biopsy–polymerase chain reaction test improved their reproductive outcomes (69). After 6-month administration of the
antitubercular agents, the clinical pregnancy rate within
12 months was about 90%.
These ﬁndings support the idea that antibiotic treatment
is a promising therapeutic option to improve the pregnancy
outcome in infertile women with CE. Prospective randomized
controlled trials are required to verify these results.

CONCLUSION
The impact of endometritis, particularly of CE, on human
pregnancy has been extensively researched over the last
decade, and the potential association is becoming more
apparent. However, clinical evidence is still scarce about the
causality between endometritis and reproductive failure
including RIF, RPL, and obstetric complications. The introduction of molecular microbial technology (i.e., microbiome)
into clinical practice is being actively carried out. Recent
comprehensive microbial analysis based on next-generation
sequencing of the 16S ribosomal subunit and/or focused
real time polymerase chain reaction was shown to be a fast
and inexpensive tool that can allow for the identiﬁcation of
both culturable and nonculturable pathogenic microorganisms associated with CE (22, 81, 82). These new approaches
have the potential to shed light on the relationship between
endometritis and unknown infectious conditions in the
uterine cavity.
