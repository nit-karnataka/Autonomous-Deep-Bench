Abstract
AIM: To determine the incidence and risk factors for
colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with ulcerative colitis
from a low prevalence region for CRC.
METHODS: Our prospective database yielded a
cohort of 430 patients [age: 44 ± 14.6 years; 248
men (57.7%)] with ulcerative colitis (median disease
duration 6, range: 1-39 years) for analysis. Of these,
131 (30.5%) had left-sided colitis and 159 (37%)
extensive colitis. Patients with histologically confirmed
CRC within the segment with colitis were compared
with those without CRC, to determine the risk factors
for the development of CRC.
RESULTS: Twelve patients (2.8%) developed CRC. The
overall incidence density was 3.56/1000 patient-years
of disease - 3/1000 in the first 10 years, 3.3/1000 at 10
to 20 years, and 7/1000 at > 20 years. Three of our 12
patients developed CRC within 8 years of disease onset.
On univariate analysis, extensive colitis, longer duration
of disease, and poor control of disease were associated
with development of CRC. On multivariate analysis,
duration of disease and extent of colitis remained
significant.
CONCLUSION: CRC occurred in 2.8% of patients with
ulcerative colitis in our population - an incidence density
similar to that in Western countries in spite of a low
overall prevalence of colon cancer in our population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is an analysis of a prospectively maintained
database of a cohort of patients with ulcerative
colitis presenting to the Division of Gastroenterology
since 2005. The data include demography, history,
examination findings, laboratory investigations, colo­
noscopy (patients with disease proximal to splenic
flexure were considered to have extensive colitis) and
histology findings, imaging findings, diagnosis, therapy
(medical and surgical), duration of disease and therapy,
compliance with therapy (taking more than 85% of
the prescribed dose of medications was considered
“compliant with treatment”), response to treatment,
course, complications of disease, and extra-intestinal
manifestations.
Currently, colonoscopic surveillance is advised
routinely to our patients with more than 8 years’
history of ulcerative colitis, irrespective of extent of
disease. Follow up was recorded during their hospital
visits, failing which they were contacted by telephone,
e-mail or post, for update on their disease status.
Patients with less than one-year duration of ulcerative
colitis and those with less than one year of follow up
were excluded from analysis in this study. Disease
control was considered good when bowel frequency
was normal, and there was no blood in stool and no
systemic symptoms; when they were symptomatic,
[10]
Truelove and Witt’s criteria
were used to assess
disease severity; mild and moderate activity was
considered as average control and severe activity was
considered as poor control.
Data of patients with confirmed diagnosis of CRC
on endoscopic biopsy and/or operative specimens
were analysed with regard to details of location of
malignancy, whether it occurred in the segment with
macroscopic colitis, stage of disease, presence of
metastatic disease, and outcome. These patients were
compared to those without malignancy to identify
possible risk factors for development of malignancy.

Core tip: From an area with low prevalence of colon
cancer, the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients
with ulcerative colitis was as high as in those with
high risk of CRC. Some patients developed CRC before
the recommended commencement of colonoscopic
surveillance for CRC.

INTRODUCTION
The risk of development of colorectal cancer (CRC)
in patients with ulcerative colitis varies in literature.
[1]
A meta-analysis by Eaden et al in 2001 concluded
that the cumulative probability of CRC was 2% by 10
years, 8% by 20 years, and 18% by 30 years. The
[2]
meta-analysis by Lutgens et al shortlisted eight
studies from 1988 to 2009 and reported that the risk
of CRC is increased in inflammatory bowel disease but
is not as high as reported in earlier studies; the pooled
standardized incidence rate (SIR) was 1.7 (95%CI:
1.2-2.2).
These studies come from regions where the
prevalence of CRC itself is high. India has an incidence
of CRC that is approximately a tenth of that in the
[3]
Western world . It would be interesting to see
whether the intrinsically lower risk in the population
would translate to a lower overall risk in patients
with ulcerative colitis. Previous studies from India do
[4,5]
indeed point to a lower risk ; however, the duration
of ulcerative colitis in the patient population evaluated
has been low, with only a small percent exceeding
10 year follow up. The recent Asia-Pacific consensus
statement on ulcerative colitis highlighted the paucity
[6]
of data on CRC in the Asian population .
In an attempt to diagnose CRC early, various societies
[6-8]
have proposed surveillance guidelines
. Survival
benefit from colonoscopic surveillance programmes in
ulcerative colitis has not been conclusively established,
but there seem to be fewer deaths in patients under­
[7-9]
going surveillance
. Surveillance guidelines in an
otherwise low-risk population should depend on the risk
increase of CRC with ulcerative colitis.
We therefore analysed the incidence of CRC in our

than one year of duration of disease). Of the 430
patients analysed [age: 44 ± 14.6 years; 248 males
(57.7%)], 38 (8.8%) had proctitis, 95 (22.1%)
procto-sigmoiditis, 131 (30.5%) left-sided colitis, and
159 (37%) extensive colitis; disease extent was not
recorded in 7 patients but all these had extent beyond
the rectum. The duration of ulcerative colitis was 1 to
10 years in 301 (70%) patients, 11 to 20 years in 107
(24.9%), and 21 or more years in 22 (5.1%) patients.
The median duration of disease was 6 (range: 1-39

Analysis of factors affecting the development of CRC

Table 1 compares patients with and without CRC. For
univariate analysis, age, gender, duration of disease,
extent of colitis, history of smoking, family history of
inflammatory bowel disease, medication compliance,
and disease control were included. Pancolitis (p =
0.012), longer duration of disease (p = 0.00001), and
poor control of disease (p = 0.007) were associated
with development of CRC. On multivariate analysis,
longer duration of disease (p = 0.01) and pancolitis (p
= 0.027) were significant factors for development of
malignancy.

Details of CRCs

Table 2 shows details of the patients with CRC.
Malignancy developed at a median of 18 (range: 6-27
years; IQR 8) years after the onset of ulcerative colitis.
Tumours were located in the rectum in six patients,
recto-sigmoid junction in one, descending colon in
one, ascending colon in two, and left colon in one
patient. Two patients had multifocal tumours: one
had 3 tumours (one each in the ascending, transverse
and descending colon), and the other patient had 2
tumours (one each in the ascending colon and at the
hepatic flexure).
In three patients, CRC developed with disease
duration of less than 8 years. The first patient (aged
51 years) with pancolitis developed CRC after 6 years
of disease and had 3 tumours. The second patient
(aged 42 years), also with pancolitis, had adenoma in
the rectum but refused surgery for 2 years. Two years
later (7 years’ disease duration) he agreed to surgery
when biopsy showed adenocarcinoma in the adenoma.
The third patient (aged 40 years) with left-sided colitis
was incidentally detected to have lung metastases
when she underwent high-resolution CT scan of the
chest (at disease duration of 6 years) as part of a

Development of CRCs

Twelve patients (2.79%) developed CRC and six
developed non-colorectal malignancies (one each
with acute myeloid leukaemia, carcinoma breast,
cholangiocarcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, laryngeal
cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma). The risk of CRC
was higher in patients with pancolitis (9/159; 5.6%)
than with the other extents of disease (3/130; 2.3%) (p
= 0.0125). One CRC was detected during surveillance
at 11 years whereas others were detected during
work-up for symptoms. The overall incidence density
of CRC was 3.6 per 1000 person-year disease (PYD):
2.3/1000 PYD in the first 10 years, 3.3/1000 PYD in
the second decade, and 7/1000 PYD thereafter. Three
of 12 patients developed CRC within 8 years of disease
onset (one patient had lung metastases). Associated
primary sclerosing cholangitis was present in four
patients - one developed cholangiocarcinoma and one
CRC. No patient reported the occurrence of CRC in a
first-degree relative.

The pathological stage of CRC was known in 10

cancer in the Indian population. This supports the
contention that ulcerative colitis is a risk factor for
tumour and therefore requires surveillance. If we look
at the reason for relatively high prevalence of CRC
in an area with low prevalence for CRC, there are no
clear answer but some questions arise: It may be
related to prevalence of UC in India. A study from India
has shown that the incidence and prevalence of UC
(incidence 6.02/100000 and prevalence 44.3/100000)
[26]
is comparable to the west . The prevalence is higher
[27]
that the rest of Asia . The studies on migrant Indian
in Leicestershire have suggested that Indian may
be more susceptible to inflammatory bowel disease
[28,29]
(IBD) than the caucasians (rr = 2.45)
. Secondly
more than prevalence, it may be related to disease
phenotypes in Indian patients. There is mixed literature
[30]
on this. A study by Walker et al
compared the IBD
disease phenotypes between South Asians (India,
Paksistan and Bangladesh) and Northern Europeans
living in London. The phenotype of ulcerative colitis
differed significantly: higher number of of South
Asian patients had extensive colitis as compared
to Northern Eurpean patients (63% vs 42.5%, p =
0.0001); The colectomy rate was non significantly
lower in migrant population; they did not study the
cancer development. Another study reported in an
abstract form compared UC phenotype in native (living
in Nagpur, Central India) Indian, Indians migrated to
the United States of America (Indian-American) and
[31]
Caucasian Americans . Proportion of patients with
pancolitis was 34.7% in Indians, 65.9% in Indian
Americans and 62.9% in Caucasian Americans.
Indian Americans were more likely to have colectomy
than Indian in India. So the prevalence and disease
phenotypes do not seem to explain the high likelihood
of CRC. Another factor like disease control may explain
the high liklihood of cancer.
Our study showed that pancolitis and duration of
disease are significantly associated with increased
likelihood of CRC, in keeping with previous literature.
Age, gender, history of smoking, family history of
inflammatory bowel disease, duration of 5-ASA
therapy, azathioprine therapy and compliance with
therapy were not significant associations.
Guidelines by various societies suggest that sur­
veillance for CRC should begin after 8 to 10 years of
[7-9]
disease duration . However, if these recommendations
are followed, CRC may be missed. Three of 12 patients
with CRC in our study developed the malignancy at
6, 6 and 7 years; one of them had lung metastases
at presentation. In another Indian study, by Kochhar
[4]
et al , 2 of 8 patients with ulcerative colitis developed
CRC at 7 and 8 years’ disease duration. In the study
[17]
by Gilat et al , 2 of 26 patients who developed CRC
in ulcerative colitis had disease duration less than 10
[21]
years (6 and 9 years). In the study by Gong et al ,
cumulative risk of CRC in the first decade was 1.15
%, similar to the 1.6 % in the meta-analysis by Eaden
[1]
[32]
et al , Lutgens et al
reported that 15% of their

DISCUSSION
Our study found a prevalence rate of 2.8% for colon
cancer in a cohort of 430 patients with ulcerative
colitis. This is similar to that reported in previously
published studies, predominantly from the Western
world, where prevalence rates of CRC in ulcerative
[11-16]
colitis varied from 0.7% to 3.3%
.
The trend in Asia is not clear; studies have shown
that the likelihood of CRC is low, ranging from 0.8%
[4,5,17-21]
to 1.8%
. Our study, taken together with two
[4,5]
others from India , provides insight into the risk
[4]
of CRC in ulcerative colitis in India. Kochhar et al
reported that the risk of CRC in ulcerative colitis was
[5]
1.8%; Venkataraman et al reported a lower rate of
CRC (0.94%). Our study reports a higher rate (2.79%).
This is possibly a result of having a greater number
of patients with duration of ulcerative colitis greater
than 20 years. The duration of ulcerative colitis has not
[4]
been specified in the study by Kochhar et al , and the
lower mean duration of follow up (6 years) in the study
[5]
from Vellore with no increase in incidence density
between 10 and 20 years also suggests a shorter
disease duration. Colectomy rates were similar in the
[5]
two studies (8.8% in the Vellore study and 7.4% in
ours) and could not account for the difference.
Two recent studies from the West have reached
different conclusions about the increased risk of colon
[22]
cancer in ulcerative colitis. Jess et al , in a populationbased study from Denmark, suggested that the risk
of colon cancer in ulcerative colitis is not as high as
previously reported and in fact may not be different
than that in the general population. To the contrary,
[23]
Herrinton et al , from California showed that the
risk of CRC in ulcerative colitis is 60% higher than in
age- and gender-matched cohorts of people without
inflammatory bowel disease, and the risk remained
the same throughout the study period of 14.5 years.
Recent data suggest that the age-adjusted rates
of CRC in the general Indian population vary from
2.65 to 3.06/100000 in men and 3.40/100000 in
[3,24,25]
women
. The low prevalence of colon cancer in
the general population can be seen by the absence
of a single case of colon cancer amongst firstdegree relatives of our cohort of patients. The risk
of CRC in Indian patients with ulcerative colitis thus
appears much higher (900 times) than in the general
population. This is a much larger risk factor than that
in West, owing to the far lower prevalence of colon

patients with ulcerative colitis developed CRC before
the recommended surveillance. A recent analysis from
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER)
data suggested an increased rate of missed CRC in
[33]
older patients with inflammatory bowel disease . It is
not clear if this can be applied to patients in other age
groups with ulcerative colitis but it has relevance to
surveillance strategy. Thus, although a strong body of
literature suggests that few patients develop CRC with
ulcerative colitis disease duration less than 10 years,
it appears that approximately 10% to 20% of cancers
may occur earlier during the course of the disease.
In summary, 12 (2.8%) patients with ulcerative
colitis in our study developed CRC during a mean
follow up of 7.8 years. The overall incidence density
of cancer was 3.6 per 1000 person-year disease, with
the incidence increasing with each decade. Extensive
disease and duration of disease were significant risk
factors for the development of CRC. Two patients had
multifocal tumours; four of nine patients had nodal
involvement, and one had metastases at presentation.
A fourth of our patients developed cancer with disease
duration less than 8 years. This study points to a
significant increase in the incidence of colon cancer
in ulcerative colitis over the population incidence and
supports the recommendation for screening patients
with ulcerative colitis even in a low-endemicity zone for
colon cancer.

This study presents the prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) ulcerative colitis
from an area with low prevalence for colon cancer.
The epidemiology of CRC in ulcerative colitis is changing with many studies
suggesting lower CRC rates. This study suggests that CRC prevalence
in ulcerative colitis patients from an area with low prevalence for CRC is
equivalent to that in the areas with high prevalence for CRCs. The disease
extent, severity and other factors do not explain this fully.

Applications

To study the differences in epidemiology in CRC in patients with ulcerative
colitis in different parts of and to look at the innovative ways of colonoscopic
surveillance in ulcerative colitis.

Peer-review

In this manuscript, the authors assessed the incidence and risk factors for CRC
in patients with ulcerative colitis from a low prevalence region for CRC. They
concluded that an incidence density of CRC in population with a low overall
prevalence of colon cancer similar to that in Western countries, and the risk
increased with extent and duration of disease. Their conclusions are reliable.
Similar article however, the context lacks of novelty and can not provide new
insights into CRC.
