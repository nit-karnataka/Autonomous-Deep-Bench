Abstract

Article history:
Accepted January 28, 2016

Context: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is the surgical standard for treating
large or complex renal stones. Since its inception, the technique of PCNL has undergone
many modifications.
Objective: To perform a collaborative review on the latest evidence related to outcomes
and innovations in the practice of PCNL since 2000.
Evidence acquisition: A literature review was performed using the PubMed database
between 2000 and July 2015, restricted to human species, adults, and the English
language. The Medline search used a strategy including the following keywords:
percutaneous nephrolithotomy, PNL, advances, trends, technique, and the Medical Subject
Headings term percutaneous nephrostomy.
Evidence synthesis: Population-based studies have now provided a wealth of information regarding patient outcomes following PCNL. The complexity of the stone treated can
be quantiﬁed using a variety of validated nephrolithometry classiﬁcation systems.
Increasing familiarity with the supine approach to PCNL has enabled simultaneous
combined retrograde and antegrade surgery. Advances such as endoscopic guided
percutaneous access may help urologists achieve access with less morbidity. Increasing
miniaturization of equipment has led to the development of mini, micro, and ultramini
techniques. The tubeless method of PCNL is now accepted practice with good evidence of
safety in appropriately selected patients.
Conclusions: Modern-day PCNL allows personalized stone management tailored to
individual patient and surgeon factors. Future studies should continue to reﬁne methods
to assess complexity and safety and to determine consensus on the use of miniaturized
PCNL.
Patient summary: Modern-day percutaneous nephrolithotomy has transformed from
an operation traditionally undertaken in one position, using one access method with one
set of instrumentation and one surgeon, to one with a variety of options at each step.

Introduction

It is often overlooked that the first description of percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) was a prolonged affair. In 1976,
Fernström and Johansson reported on three patients who
were unsuitable for open surgery and who had renal stones
removed using a percutaneous technique [1]. A nephrostomy
was inserted under local anesthesia and the tract dilated with
a Couvelaire catheter, which was exchanged for larger
catheters. Once the appropriate size was achieved, a catheter
was left in place for 14 d. The stones were finally removed
using fluoroscopy for intrarenal guidance.
This landmark publication led to the birth of endourology. Since 2000, PCNL has made open surgery for complex
renal stones obsolete in most countries. We reviewed the
latest developments in the practice of PCNL since then,
including systematic efforts to assess outcomes and
innovations in technique to enhance performance.

2.

Evidence acquisition

A review of the literature was performed using PubMed. We
identified original articles on PCNL restricted to the English
language. Inclusion criteria were articles published from

Idenﬁcaon

(n = 3597)

January 2000 to July 2015, discussing outcomes and
innovations in surgical technique. All experimental and
observational study designs were eligible for inclusion,
including but not limited to controlled clinical trials, case
series, and case–control and cohort studies. Comments,
editorials, and review articles were not considered eligible.
The literature search was conducted by the first author
using the keywords percutaneous nephrolithotomy OR PNL
and then restricted with the keywords (AND) advances OR
trends OR technique. This search identified 3597 records.
After excluding duplicate references, 3312 unique references were reviewed by title or abstract. A list of articles
judged to be highly relevant by the junior (K.R.G.) and senior
(J.dlR.) authors was circulated among the coauthors, and a
final consensus was reached on the structure of this review
and the articles included. Eligible studies known to the
authors but not picked up by the search were also evaluated
for inclusion. This resulted in an additional 22 unique
records. Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the search process. A
total of 134 unique references from this search were
included in the qualitative synthesis. The studies included
are varied (controlled clinical trials, case series, and case–
control and cohort studies). Due to the likely heterogeneity
of studies and the nonstandardized quality appraisal, a
narrative synthesis rather than a quantified meta-analysis

of data was performed. The limitations of using a single
database for review are acknowledged [2]. In addition,
outcomes may be limited by study heterogeneity and
selection bias.

[11]. Increasing utilization in older and sicker patients may
account for some of these findings [5]. Mortality, however,
remains a rare complication at approximately 0.2% and is
unchanged [5,11].

Evidence synthesis

3.1.

Indications for percutaneous nephrolithotomy

The European Association of Urology guidelines recommend PCNL for the treatment of renal stones 2 cm and
lower pole stones 1.5 cm [3]. The American Urological
Association (AUA) guidelines recommend PCNL as the firstline treatment for staghorn calculi [4].
3.1.1.

Trends in percutaneous nephrolithotomy publications

Supplementary Figure 1 demonstrates the number of publications in PubMed from 2000 to 2014 pertaining to the three
most common treatment modalities for renal stones:
shockwave lithotripsy (SWL), ureteroscopy (URS), and PCNL.
3.1.2.

Trends in percutaneous nephrolithotomy utilization

PCNL utilization over the past decade has varied depending
on the data source studied. An analysis of the Nationwide
Inpatient Sample, an administrative data set containing 20%
of all community hospitals in the United States, demonstrated an increase in the annual rate of PCNL during the period
1999–2009 [5]. Women saw the greatest increases compared
with men. Similarly, PCNL use also increased in the United
Kingdom [6]. In contrast, Lee and Bariol studied rates of stone
procedures using data from the primary funder of health care
in Australia [7]. Although the total number of all stonerelated procedures had increased, the proportion for PCNL
had decreased from 6% in 1995 to <3.5% in 2010. More
recently, Ordon and colleagues studied trends for urolithiasis
procedures in the Canadian province of Ontario and found
PCNL use remained stable from 1991 to 2010 [8].
Local factors, availability, and expertise clearly influence
the utilization of PCNL. In the United States, it accounts for
4.5% of all stone procedures [9]. In those countries more
reliant on reusable instrumentation, its utilization is likely
to be much higher. Although PCNL may not be as common
as SWL or URS, it remains the signature piece for treating
complex renal stones, a major procedure with the potential
for significant morbidity.
3.2.

Percutaneous nephrolithotomy outcomes

3.2.1.

Administrative data

The modern era has seen a number of population-based
studies assessing the prevalence and severity of complications after PCNL [5,8,10–12]. Common in-hospital complications include bleeding, urinary tract infection, fever, and
sepsis [5,11]. Factors associated with an increased risk of
complications include increasing patient age [5], female
gender [10], operative time [10], and comorbidity [5,12]. In
the United States, sepsis-related complications have increased [5]. One matter of concern is the rate of readmission
following PCNL, which is as high as 15% in the United States
[13], 12% in Canada [8], and 9% in the United Kingdom

Registry data

Unlike administrative data, registries provide clinical
details such as information on indications for surgery,
stone size and location, stone clearance, and type of
complications including the need for secondary procedures.
Of late, data from two clinical registries have highlighted
the current state of PCNL. The PCNL registry from the British
Association of Urological Surgeons provided self-reported
outcomes of >1000 PCNLs from 50 UK centers in 2010–2011
[14]. The overall complication rate was 21.3%; postoperative
fever, sepsis, and transfusion rates were 16%, 2.4%, and 2.5%,
respectively. The stone-free rate (SFR), defined as no visible
stone on imaging, was 68%. Approximately a third of PCNLs
were for staghorn stones.
The second registry is the PCNL Global Study Database
maintained by the Clinical Research Office of the Endourology Society (CROES), the largest prospectively collected
database of patients treated with PCNL. In 5724 patients
undergoing PCNL in 96 centers worldwide over a 1-yr period,
the overall complication rate was 20.5% [15]. In a separate
analysis of outcomes for staghorn stones compared with
nonstaghorn stones, frequent complications included fever
(8.7–14.8%), bleeding (6.8–10.4%), collecting system perforation (2.8–4.4%), blood transfusion (4.5–9.0%), and hydrothorax (1.6–1.9%). The 30-d SFR was 69.7% [16]. This registry
continues to be an important and growing source of
information producing multiple studies that have helped
assess the efficacy of PCNL and some of its controversies [17].
3.2.3.

Clavien-Dindo classification scheme

The diversity of complications following PCNL and the need
for uniform reporting has led to interest in the ClavienDindo system (grades 1–5) for reporting complications
[18,19]. For PCNL, the Clavien score has been shown to have
high validity, with higher scores associated with longer
length of stay (LOS) [20]. Use of this system, however, is not
as straightforward as we expect. In a CROES study of
528 patients with complications after PCNL, agreement
among urologists grading complications using the Clavien
method was moderate (k = 0.48), with the lowest agreement for complications that are grade 1 or 2 (minor
complications) [18]. To improve the reliability of reporting
with the Clavien system, PCNL-specific complications have
now been defined [18]. More recently, an expert consensus
panel defined 15 outcomes that are considered the
minimum standard when reporting on PCNL [21]. Efforts
such as these are much needed to reduce the heterogeneity
that currently exists within the literature.

postoperative complications [22]. Xue and colleagues
assessed CROES data on 1448 solitary nonstaghorn stones,
and they also found that increasing stone size, especially
stones >4 cm, was associated with significantly higher rates
of fever and blood transfusion [22]. In addition, stone
clearance suffers as size increases; the SFR for patients with
solitary stones 2–3 cm in size was 90% compared with 84.1%
if stones were >4 cm. Similar trends were noted in the UK
PCNL registry [14].

3.2.5.

Patient factors affecting percutaneous nephrolithotomy

outcomes

Increasing patient age and obesity are risk factors for
unsatisfactory outcomes after PCNL. In a study of 334 patients
70 yr of age matched with younger patients, the
complication rate was increased twofold in older patients,
who also had a greater chance of experiencing higher
grade Clavien complications [27]. In contrast, PCNL in obese
patients was associated with significantly longer operative
times, lower SFRs, and higher retreatment rates but not an
increase in complications [28]. Another factor to consider is
anticoagulation during PCNL. With careful perioperative
management, PCNL can be performed safely and efficiently in
properly selected patients on long-term anticoagulation [29].

3.2.4.2. Staghorn stones. Staghorn stones remain the most
challenging stone to treat with PCNL. A meta-analysis
conducted by the AUA guidelines panel on staghorn calculi
showed that PCNL alone had the highest SFR (78%) for
treating staghorn stones in comparison with combination
therapy with SWL (66%) or SWL monotherapy (54%)
[4]. More recently, of 1466 patients with staghorn stones
undergoing PCNL in the CROES database, the SFR was only
56.9% [16]. SFRs for staghorn stones were even lower in the
UK registry [14]. Increasing staghorn volume and complexity may predict the need for multiple tracts and staged
procedures for successful stone clearance [23]. Success
rates, however, may be higher in centers that have greater
experience dealing with these stones. In an evaluation of
773 patients with staghorn stones, SFRs increased from 81%
to 93% over an 18-yr period [24]. Data such as these suggest
that staghorn stones might be better managed in tertiary
referral centers adept at dealing with these complex stones.

3.2.6.

Surgical volume and percutaneous nephrolithotomy outcomes

Multiple reports have confirmed a volume–outcome
relationship with PCNL. An early study analyzing the US
nationwide data from 1988 to 2002 demonstrated a
statistically significant increase in mortality in centers that
performed fewer than nine cases per year [30]. More
contemporary data suggest that higher volume surgeons
have lower costs and their patients have shorter LOS
[31]. Similarly, Kadlec et al demonstrated that hospitals
who perform >33 PCNLs per year had significantly lower
LOS [12]. CROES data have revealed that high-volume
centers have lower complications and LOS, as well as better
SFRs [32]. The highest SFRs were achieved in centers
performing >120 cases per year. It is therefore not
surprising that PCNL delivery has been increasingly
regionalized to these high-volume centers [20,33].

3.2.4.3. Hounsfield unit. In addition to stone size and location,
the Hounsfield unit (HU) of the stone on computed
tomography (CT) may predict the success of PCNL. In a
study of 179 patients undergoing PCNL, Gucuk et al found a
HU <678 significantly decreased the likelihood of stone
clearance [25]. In a larger CROES study, both very high and
low HU values were associated with lower SFRs and long
operative times [26]. Stones with low HU are especially likely
to be uric acid or struvite in composition, which are poorly
visible on fluoroscopy and thus more difficult to identify
during PCNL.

3.3.

Surgical complexity: scoring systems for percutaneous

nephrolithotomy

The desire to predict outcomes for PCNL and, in particular, the
important end point of SFR has led to the development
of numerous nephrolithometric scoring systems (Table 1)
[34–37]. By quantifying the complexity of the stone
being treated, these scoring systems allow for likewise

comparisons of PCNL. They also serve as a useful aid for
patient counseling and help identify those cases that might
need staged or ancillary procedures for complete stone
clearance. Supplement 1 provides details of these different
scoring systems (Guy’s Stone Score [GSS], STONE score, Seoul
National University Renal Stone Complexity, and CROES
nomogram). Supplementary Table 1 summarizes studies that
have validated these scoring systems [38–45]. Okhunov et al
found that the STONE score was able to predict the SFR with
an accuracy of 83.1%, greater than any individual component
of the score [37]. Smith et al found the CROES nomogram was
better at predicting treatment success and SFR compared
with the GSS (area under the curve = 0.76 vs 0.69; p < 0.001)
[36]. In contrast, in a separate study assessing the GSS and the
STONE score, there were no significant differences in
predictive accuracy for SFR (0.74 vs 0.63; p = 0.06, respectively) [41]. The problem with some of these scoring systems
is that certain criteria have unclear definitions, which hinders
the overall interrater reliability [38,46]. No particular scoring
system has been found to be vastly superior for predicting the
SFR [41,42,45].

Technical advances

Figure 2 provides an evolutionary timeline of the various
advances in surgical techniques.
3.4.1.

Positioning

[(Fig._2)TD$IG]

The prone position is the conventional method for performing PCNL, and for many years this aspect of surgery did not
change. The supine position, originally described by Valdivia
Uria and colleagues, poses less risk on positioning-related

injuries and avoids the extra time needed for turning the
patient to the prone position [47]. According to CROES data, it
is currently used in 20% of centers worldwide; however, its
practice in North America and Australia is more limited
[48]. Proponents of supine positioning have advocated it is
less demanding on patients with respiratory or cardiac
difficulties. In addition, the downward direction of the tract
and sheath helps with spontaneous drainage of fragments,
and these lower pressures may result in less fluid absorption.
It may also be much easier to reach the upper calyx through a
lower pole puncture in the supine position compared with
the prone because of a wider angle between the lower and
upper calyx axes when supine [49].
Yet these perceived advantages have not been realized
into any obvious clinical superiority when compared with
the traditional prone method (Table 2) [48,50–63], except in
some studies where the operative times have been shorter
with the supine technique [50,56,57]. More importantly,
these studies tell us that supine did not expose patients to
more access-related bowel injury. Nevertheless, drawbacks
such as a restricted working space, difficulty in performing
upper pole puncture, and awkward rigid nephroscope
manipulation requiring in several cases complementary
flexible nephroscopy to overcome this limitation, have
limited its universal adoption [64]. In a recent study
assessing patients undergoing PCNL, no differences in peak
inspiratory pressure were noted when the patient was
prone versus supine [65].
One significant benefit of the innovation in supine
technique is that it has enabled investigators to perform
combined antegrade and retrograde procedures during
PCNL. Many variations in the supine position have now been

reported including supine decubitus [66], Galdakao-modified Valdivia [67], and the Barts flank-free modified position
[68], to name a few. Most of these modifications ease the
access to the urethra, which allows for more comfortable
simultaneous retrograde techniques during PCNL.
3.4.2.

Endoscopic guidance to facilitate renal access

Obtaining safe percutaneous renal access is the hallmark of
a good PCNL. Standard methods for obtaining access include
fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance that is performed
either by urologists or radiologists. Dilatation techniques in
standard use include Amplatz dilation, metal telescopic
dilation, and balloon dilation [69]. In recent years, a
minority of surgeons are performing alternative techniques
such as endoscopic guided access (EGA) to facilitate
retrograde or antegrade punctures [70].
3.4.2.1. Antegrade puncture: coming in. Initial reports of antegrade EGA consisted of the patient in the prone split-leg
position, with URS used to confirm accurate caliceal
puncture, after which it was removed following dilatation
of the tract. Kidd and Conlin caught the antegrade puncture
wire with a ureteroscopic basket and brought it out through
the urethra, thus securing ‘‘through and through’’ access
[71]. It was used as an aid to help for difficult cases such as
complete staghorn or morbid obesity. Subsequently, Khan
et al used it as a first-line procedure with combined
fluoroscopic access, utilizing a ureteral access sheath and
flexible URS for direct visualization of the puncture
[72]. Proponents of this method cite advantages for a more
accurate and safe caliceal puncture, and less utilization of
radiation.
3.4.2.2. Endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery. Scoffone and

coworkers broadened the scope of antegrade EGA by
performing retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) at the
same time as PCNL in patients placed in the Galdakaomodified Valdivia position [73]. The concept extended
beyond guiding a safe puncture but also used URS to
improve stone clearance and treat stones that would be
difficult to access through the percutaneous tract. In
127 patients, a single access was feasible in 98.4%, with
an SFR of 81.9%. This technique allows for improved
antegrade drainage and retrieval of fragments via the
ureteral access sheath. More importantly, stones in parallel
lying calyces do not necessitate a second puncture and are
amenable to simultaneous RIRS [74]. Larger stones can also
be basketed with the URS and relocated to the tract where
they can then be retrieved via the rigid nephroscope, a
maneuver known as pass the ball [75].
Endoscopic combined intrarenal surgery (ECIRS) is also
feasible in the prone split-leg position. Isac et al compared
prone EGA with standard fluoroscopic guided access and
found overall operative times and bleeding were significantly reduced in patients undergoing EGA [76]. Secondary
procedures to clear stones were significantly lower in these
patients.
In a separate comparative study, ECIRS with a single
small tract (18F) was compared with conventional PCNL.

The results suggest ECIRS may be superior in SFR (81.7% vs
45.1%), with a lower incidence of bleeding, although a
properly randomized study is required to confirm [77]. Although there may be distinct advantages to EGA or ECIRS, it
is more costly because it requires two operating surgeons
with two sets of equipment and ancillary instrumentation.
In addition, if a stone occupies the target calyx, retrograde
holmium laser lithotripsy is needed to clear a passage for
the URS to visualize the puncture. Comprehensive valuebased studies are needed to further establish the role of this
method, especially in comparison with scenarios where
access is obtained by radiologists instead of urologists.
3.4.3.

Miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy

The desire to reduce access-related complications and the
morbidity related to the size of the tract has led to
investigators assessing PCNL using smaller caliber instruments. This has opened the field to the increasing
miniaturization of PCNL, with tracts ranging from 24F to
5F now available. The smaller instrumentation places less
stress on the kidney and results in less bleeding compared
with standard 30F instruments; however, to date, most
studies comparing minimally invasive PCNL with standard
PCNL have failed to demonstrate considerable differences in
outcomes (Table 3) [78–93]. The preponderance of smaller
instruments has led to calls for better labeling of PCNL, in
relation to the size of the tract (ie, PCNL+20, PCNL+30,
PCNL+12) [94]. An alternative nomenclature that has been
suggested uses XL, L, M, S, XS, and XSS to signify tract sizes
(F) of 25, 20 to <25, 15 to <20, 10 to <15, 5 to <10, and <5,
respectively [95].
3.4.3.1. Mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Mini-PCNL sets with
sheath sizes are available in sizes of 15, 18, 19.5, or 24F
[96]. One of the main attractions of mini-PCNL in
comparison with other minimally invasive PCNLs is that
it maintains the ability to use flexible nephroscopy.
Regardless, superior nephron sparing has not been demonstrated when compared with standard PCNL [97], although
mini-PCNL has shown a trend toward fewer complications
and less bleeding, with less analgesic use. This may come at
the cost of a lower SFR and longer operative times [80]. The
benefit over RIRS may be a better SFR [85,87,88], avoidance
of a ureteral stent, and reduced cost related to endourologic
equipment such as flexible URS that may be harder to
source and maintain in developing countries.
3.4.3.2. Ultramini percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Ultramini-PCNL
uses a 6F inner sheath and 13F outer sheath that
accommodates a 3.5F miniature nephroscope. Stones are
fragmented with laser, but a side channel is used for
irrigation of saline that produces an eddy of water current to
evacuate the fragments. Experience with this technique is
mostly limited to a single center [93] (Table 3).
3.4.3.3. Micro percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Bader et al used a
0.9-mm diameter micro-optical needle connected to a light
source to perform optical puncture into the targeted calyx
in 15 patients undergoing PCNL [92]. This was further

developed so that the whole PCNL was done through a 4.85F
tract using the optical needle as camera without dilatation:
micro-PCNL [90]. In a later randomized controlled trial
(RCT) comparing micro-PCNL with RIRS for treating stones
<1.5 cm, no differences in SFRs were found [89]; however,
micro-PCNL was associated with greater blood loss,
increased pain, and more analgesic use. Another drawback
of micro-PCNL is the risk of conversion to standard or
mini-PCNL due to bleeding obscuring vision [90,91]. In
addition, stones cannot be retrieved through the small
working channel but only pulverized using the holmium
laser, and most importantly, there is no outflow from the
scope that can cause a significant increase in intrarenal
pressure [98].
In general, it has yet to be seen whether micro and
ultramini approaches will have a routine place in our
armamentarium and overtake RIRS, which is less invasive
and does not necessitate percutaneous access skills. They
could have a unique role in treating 1- to 1.5-cm lower pole
stones that are inaccessible to flexible URS but not big
enough for a standard PCNL. Moreover, innovations in these
instruments are likely to benefit percutaneous surgery in
children.
3.4.4.

Exit strategy: tubeless

Nephrostomy tubes traditionally are placed at the end of
PCNL with the intended purpose of tamponading bleeding
from the tract, promoting urinary drainage in the event of
ureteral obstruction, and maintaining access in case of the
need for a second-look procedure. Multiple comparative
studies over the last decade have confirmed that in selected
cases, outcomes are not compromised if patients are
managed with a ureteral stent and no nephrostomy tube
(tubeless), or even without [99,100] a stent or nephrostomy
tube (totally tubeless) [101].
The tubeless technique for PCNL has been extensively
studied with at least 19 RCTs examining the efficacy of this
approach (Table 4) [99,100,102–118]. The main reasons for
using a tubeless technique are to reduce postoperative pain,
analgesic requirements, and LOS. Multiple studies have
shown that in the uncomplicated case, tubeless does not
lead to an increase in complications [119]. Other options for
a tubeless method are to use open-ended ureteral catheters
that are removed the following day or tethered stents
coming out of the tract that are removed in the office
[102]. The attraction of the totally tubeless method is
avoidance of a second procedure to remove the ureteral
stent, as well as stent-related morbidity.
Contraindications for a tubeless technique include significant bleeding, major collecting system perforation, infection
stones, and where multiple tracts have been undertaken.
Relative contraindications include staghorn stones and
patients with a reconstructed urinary tract. Investigators
have assessed the role of hemostatic and biologic sealants in
preventing bleeding from the tract or urinary leakage from
the flank, but the routine use of these agents is unnecessary
and costly [120]. Even in the best of hands, not all PCNLs are
feasible for a tubeless approach [121]. If a tube is to be placed,
a larger tube may result in lower bleeding and fewer

complications [122], although larger tubes are associated
with increased postoperative pain [116,123].
3.5.

Postprocedure: imaging and residual fragments

Recent work utilizing CT in the follow-up of patients has
evaluated the long-term significance of residual fragments
(RFs) after PCNL. Raman and coworkers followed 42 patients
with CT-detected RFs over a median of 32 mo and found that
43% experienced a stone-related event [124]. On multivariate analysis, RFs >2 mm were the only independent
predictor of a stone event. In a larger study of 75 patients
with CT follow-up, Osman et al found that RFs >3 mm
significantly predicted stone growth and secondary interventions [125]. In contrast, in 129 patients followed after
PCNL for a median of 5.4 yr, the cumulative retreatment
rates were equivalent for patients with RFs <2 and >2 mm
(30–33%) [126]; however, patients who were completely
stone free had a retreatment rate of only 4%.
Steps to maximize stone clearance at PCNL include routine
use of flexible nephroscopy, high-resolution fluoroscopy
[127], and perioperative CT to assess the need for intervention in the same admission. Second-look procedures in
patients with RFs >4 mm were found to be cost effective
when compared with an observational strategy [128]. Even in
expert hands, obtaining completely stone-free outcomes can
be challenging [127]. However, not all RFs are equal. Those
located in the lower pole, renal pelvis, infection stones, or
associated with a previous intervention, renal failure, and
metabolic abnormalities may have greater clinical consequences [129]. In particular, non–calcium-based stones such
as struvite and uric acid have a far greater risk of retreatment
[126].
3.6.

Future directions

What will PCNL look like in 5–10 yr? First, the quest for the
perfect access technique will continue. Preoperative planning might routinely incorporate three-dimensional (3D)
CT planning [130] including the use of easy to engineer 3D
models for navigation [131]. Access may incorporate
augmented technology using tablet computers to superimpose CT images [132] or rely on tracking systems [133]. In
terms of instrumentation, it is possible we may do more
mini-PCNLs because with mini-PCNL one can rely on the
suction effect of the increased flow. The question remains
though, what size? This may eventually be somewhere
between 16 and 22F. As such, energy sources will become
tailored to the size of the tract. Larger sized stones, however,
may be more suited for combined ultrasound/ballistic
devices, and advances in ancillary instrumentation will be
crucial [134]. For smaller size tracts, developments in
holmium laser technology and in particular the dusting
technique may prove significant. Multipuncture, multitract
PCNL might become rare. ECIRS with PCNL could become
the standard of care in specialist centers—where a team of
surgeons will facilitate EGA, to reduce both access-related
morbidity and increase the SFR. In addition, the ambulatory
approach may become more feasible as the PCNL technique

Conclusions

Bultitude has worked as a consultant for Boston Scientiﬁc. The remaining
authors have nothing to disclose.
Funding/Support and role of the sponsor: None.

Our understanding of PCNL has vastly improved through
the study of population-based data sources and registries
that have provided a wealth of outcome information.
Adopting the Clavien-Dindo system provides a consistent
framework for improving the quality of PCNL reporting. Of
the different nephrolithometry classification systems,
although the GSS is the most studied, no single system
has been shown to be superior. Further studies and
modifications may change that in the future. Increasing
familiarity with the supine approach has opened the door
for ECIRS and single-tract surgery. Obtaining optimal renal
access is a crucial step in the learning curve of PCNL, and it is
possible that EGA could shorten this curve. The propagation
of minimally invasive refinements has been spurred by the
desire to reduce access-related complications and bleeding.
In particular, micro and ultramini techniques are in their
infancy and require further investigation. During PCNL,
efforts for initial stone clearance should be maximized to
avoid the risk of retreatment from RFs. Postprocedure, even
RFs <2 mm may have significant consequences. It is
increasingly clear that the exit strategy does not have to
be a nephrostomy tube in every single patient.
In this era in which surgical techniques are easily shared
around the world, PCNL has been transformed from an
operation traditionally undertaken in one position, using one
access method with one set of instrumentation and one
surgeon, to one with a variety of options at each step.
Consequently, we can offer personalized stone management
tailored to the local environment and individual patient.
