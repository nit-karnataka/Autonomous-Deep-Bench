Objective: To investigate an association between polymorphisms related to the implantation process that together could help in the
prediction of recurrent implantation failure (RIF).
Design: Cohort study.
Setting: Private fertility center and reproductive genetics laboratory.
Patient(s): Forty-four women presenting RIF, who were included in study group (RIF group), and two control groups, one with 63 women
who were attended at our service and became pregnant after the ﬁrst IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection attempt (control group I) and
other with 65 fertile women who had at least two children without any treatment and no history of miscarriage (control group II).
Intervention(s): None.
Main Outcome Measure(s): Genotyping was performed in the intron region of TP63, VEGFA, MMP2, ESR1, and ESR2 genes and in
the 30 untranslated region of the LIF gene on genomic DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Result(s): The presence of ESR1/AA (rs12199722) and LIF/GT (rs929271) genotypes was more frequent in the RIF group, leading to a
7.9-fold increase in the chance of women presenting with RIF when compared with women who became pregnant on their ﬁrst cycle of
IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection and a 2.8-fold increase when compared with women who became pregnant without treatment.
Conclusion(s): The association between ESR1 and LIF polymorphisms can help in the prediction of RIF. (Fertil SterilÒ 2019;111:

mplantation is a multifactorial event
in which the embryo attaches itself
to the luminal surface of the endometrium, followed by migration and
invasion into its deep layer, becoming
closely connected to the maternal endometrial surface to form the placenta (1).
This poorly understood system represents a critical step in the reproductive
process (2), and it depends on the interplay between the blastocyst and the
endometrium
(3).

ORGINAL ARTICLE: GENETICS
endometrium, a normal and functional embryo at the blastocyst developmental stage, and a synchronized dialogue between maternal and embryonic tissues are required for
successful implantation (3). Implantation failure is considered
to have occurred if there is a lack of ultrasonography evidence
of an intrauterine gestational sac. It may occur very early (during attachment or migration states) or later, after successful
migration of the embryo through the luminal surface of the
endometrium, with the disruption of the process before the formation of an intrauterine gestational sac, owing to embryo or
endometrial factors (4).
Recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a clinical condition
in which implantation has repeatedly failed to reach a stage
recognizable by ultrasonography (4, 5). Although RIF is the
most common cause of unsuccessful pregnancy after
assisted reproductive technology, there is no consensus on
its deﬁnition, despite many publications on this topic (4–9).
There are many causes of RIF, among which we can
mention gamete/embryo factors (oocyte quality, sperm
quality, parental chromosomal anomalies), maternal age,
uterine factors (congenital uterine anomalies, acquired
intracavity conditions), hydrosalpinx, immunologic factors,
thrombophilic conditions, hormonal or metabolic disorders,
and genetic abnormalities (4–7). In women with
unexplained implantation failure, despite good hormonal
response, good-quality embryos, satisfactory endometrial
development, and no identiﬁable pathology, suboptimal
endometrial receptivity is considered a key factor in inhibiting embryo implantation (2). The implantation process requires the interaction of at least four types of cells: stromal,
epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells (10).
Because genetic factors seem to be highly associated with
RIF (11), a growing number of candidate genes have been
investigated concerning their potential roles in that etiology.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have being used as
markers owing to their large number in virtually all populations, improving the ability to diagnose RIF, thereby
increasing a couple's chance of conception. In preliminary
analysis, we selected some reproduction-related genes to
identify SNPs that could be important to the implantation
process. Using next-generation sequencing we identiﬁed six
polymorphisms that were somehow related to RIF and were
used in this study: tumor protein p63 (TP63) rs12486772,
vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) rs3025010,
matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) rs2287076, estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) rs12199722, estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2)
rs1952585, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) rs929271.
It is known that the TP63 gene is a regulator of the quality
and maturation of oocytes (12). In addition, Feng et al. (13)
suggested that TP63 may have distinct functions in reproduction other than maintaining female germ cell integrity,
because they identiﬁed an association of one SNP with both
young and older patients. The VEGFA gene is important for
almost every aspect of blood vessel formation and function,
mediating angiogenesis and vasculogenesis (14). It has been
shown that polymorphisms in the VEGFA gene correlate
with variation in VEGFA protein production (15), which could
result in decreased angiogenesis and blastocyst invasion,
leading to implantation failure. The MMP2 gene belongs to

a family of zinc-dependent proteinases (MMPs) that can be
found widely distributed in human tissues. They are able to
degrade nearly all extracellular matrix proteins and are
necessary for cell migration, the healing process, development, scar formation, and other tissue changes (16). They
also play important roles in reproductive physiology, remodeling extracellular matrix during ovarian follicular growth
and ovulation (17). ESR1 and ESR2 genes are responsible
for codifying two estrogen receptors (ERa and ERb, respectively), which mediate estrogen (E) effects that are well known
on follicle growth, maturation, oocyte release (18), and endometrial preparation for implantation (19). The LIF protein is
an important mediator of embryo implantation (20), and the
inﬂuence of polymorphisms in the LIF gene has been
analyzed by several groups, helping in the understanding of
the implantation process. High concentration of LIF in follicular ﬂuid has been correlated with good embryo quality, suggesting its role in ovulation and early embryonic development
(21). It was also associated with embryo implantation and
endometrial receptivity, being part of a highly coordinated
orchestra of the reproductive process (22). Levels of LIF protein are increased at the time of expected implantation in
fertile women (23). On the other hand, lower LIF levels have
been associated with women presenting with unexplained
infertility (24, 25).
Genetic factors combined or alone can affect the implantation process; therefore, our objective was to identify the best
association between six polymorphisms (TP63 rs12486772,
VEGFA rs3025010, MMP2 rs2287076, ESR1 rs12199722,
ESR2 rs1952585, and LIF rs929271) that could help in the
prediction of RIF.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical Approval
The study was authorized by the local ethics committee (the
Ethics Committee in Research of the Reference Center for
Women Health; project reference: 045/11) and was carried
out according to the principles expressed in the Declaration
of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all
recruited subjects.

Study Population
A cohort study was conducted with blood samples from 44
infertile women (aged 35.3  2.6 years [mean  SD]) presenting RIF and two different control groups: group I, 63
women (aged 33.3  4.1 years); and group II, 65 women
(aged 52.2  10.7 years). The study population consisted
of patients who were subjected to IVF/intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI) protocols recruited at our Human
Reproduction Center between January 2014 and December
2016 (RIF group). Recurrent implantation failure was
deﬁned as failure to achieve pregnancy after three or
more IVF/ICSI attempts and ﬁve or more cleavage-stage
good morphological quality embryos transferred (4, 5).
All women were %39 year old (at the time of the ETs)
and had normal couple karyotype. The exclusion criteria
were deﬁned as the presence of uterine defects by

or
thrombophilia, and autoimmune defects (including
antiphospholipid anti-bodies).
The enrolment criteria for the control group I included patients who were subject to IVF/ICSI protocols at the same center and became pregnant on the ﬁrst attempt and had at least
one live birth. Control group II included fertile women (postmenopausal volunteers) with no history of miscarriage or
infertility treatment who had at least two live births. The inclusion criteria of postmenopausal volunteers had the purpose
to avoid possible miscarriages or future infertility problems
after recruitment for the study. These inclusion criteria were
based on published research (26, 27). None of the patients
in the study group or control group I underwent PGS/PGTA
(preimplantation genetic screening/preimplantation genetic
testing for aneuploidy) in their treatments.
All women recruited for this study were Brazilian, from
all over the country. Despite the high rate of interracial marriage in the Brazilian population, most patients and healthy
study participants described their skin color as ‘‘white.’’

DNA Samples and Genotyping
Genomic DNA for the entire studied population was extracted
from peripheral blood samples using the QIAamp DNA blood
mini kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions.
Nucleotide changes were evaluated in duplicate by realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using individual TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (Thermo Fisher) for each SNP
(TP63 rs12486772, VEGFA rs3025010, MMP2 rs2287076,
ESR1 rs12199722, ESR2 rs1952585, and LIF rs929271) and
TaqPath ProAmp Master Mix, following the manufacturer's
instructions, on a StepOne Real-time PCR System. The PCR
conditions were as follows: 60 C for 30 seconds (pre-read);
95 C for 5 minutes (initial denature, enzyme activation), 40
cycles of 95 C for 15 seconds (denature), and 60 C for 1 minute (anneal/extend). Genotyping results were validated and
conﬁrmed by the automatic sequencer XL 3500 Genetic
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using 20 samples of each genotype from each polymorphism (normal homozygous, heterozygous, and mutated homozygous) selected randomly.
For the minor allele frequency of each polymorphism, all genotypes were sequenced.

Statistical Analysis
All data were analyzed using StatsDirect statistical software
version 2.7.9 software. The following parameters were evaluated for each group analyzed: the woman's age, body mass index, time of infertility, cause of infertility, semen parameters,
endometrial thickness, total dose of recombinant FSH, number of oocytes retrieved, number of oocytes retrieved in metaphase II, and fertilization rate. The differences in the
frequencies of the SNPs genotypes, alleles, or both, in the
RIF group and control groups were also evaluated.
To compare the means of continuous variables, the
nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used if the contin-

uous variables were not normally distributed, and Student's
t test and one-way analysis of variance were used if the
continuous variables were normally distributed. The results
are expressed as the arithmetic mean  SD. For categorical
variables, Fisher's exact test was used, and the results are expressed as percentages. In addition, logistic regression
analysis was used to determine a signiﬁcant association
between all polymorphisms as a tool in the prediction of
RIF. All statistical tests were considered signiﬁcant at a level
of P< .05.

RESULTS
Table 1 represents the main characteristics of study participants. The genotype and allele frequencies of each SNP
(TP63 rs12486772, VEGFA rs3025010, MMP2 rs2287076,
ESR2 rs1952585, ESR1 rs12199722, and LIF rs929271) are
presented in Table 2. The TP63 polymorphism showed no signiﬁcant difference between the studied groups. Although
there was no difference between the VEGFA genotypes
(rs3025010), the T allele was more frequent in control group
II. MMP2/TC genotype frequency was signiﬁcantly higher
in the RIF group compared with control group II. The ESR2/
AG genotype was more frequent in control group II. The
ESR1/AA genotype was signiﬁcantly higher in the RIF group
when compared with both control groups. On the other hand,
the ESR1/AG genotype was signiﬁcantly higher in both control groups. In the RIF group, the frequency of the LIF/GT genotype was signiﬁcantly higher when compared with control
group I; however, the LIF/GG genotype was signiﬁcantly
higher in control group I. When these six polymorphisms
were used in combination with each other, we found that
the association of the LIF/GT and ESR1/AA genotypes had
a 7.9-fold increase in the chance of women being included
in the RIF group when compared with women in control
group I and a 2.8-fold increase when compared with women
in control group II (Table 3). The other SNPs combinations did
not show a signiﬁcant association.

DISCUSSION
Because RIF is a clinical condition caused by diverse genetic
and environmental factors, SNPs in some of these genes
may affect individual susceptibility to RIF at different levels
(28). This study demonstrated that, of the six polymorphisms
investigated here, three showed a signiﬁcant association with
women presenting RIF when analyzed one by one.
It has already been shown that TP63 is associated with
different reproductive functions (12, 13). Additionally, an
association of one SNP (rs12486772) of this gene and
women presenting RIF was shown in our preliminary
analysis using next-generation sequencing, being the reason
for using this SNP in this work. Here we did not ﬁnd any
association between the TP63 polymorphism (A>G,
rs12486772) and the three groups studied, perhaps owing to
the limited number of women involved in this study.
In relation to the VEGFA gene, we have previously reported an association of the VEGFA -1154 G/A (rs1570360)
polymorphism and RIF (29), but in the present study the
SNP VEGFA (T>C, rs3025010) was not correlated to the
group of women presenting RIF, even though an association

between the T allele and women who had a child without any
fertility treatment was identiﬁed.
MMP2 has been demonstrated to act in the implantation
window (period of maximal endometrial receptivity, 6–9 days
after ovulation), and women presenting idiopathic infertility
have higher expression and activity of it (30). In our study,
we showed that women with the MMP2/TC genotype (T>C,
rs2287076) had a higher chance of presenting RIF when
compared with women who had children without any fertility
treatment.
Additionally, we found that patients with the ESR1/AA
genotype (A>G, rs12199722) tend to present RIF, and women
with the ESR1/AG genotype are more likely to have children
after the ﬁrst IVF/ICSI cycle or with no treatment. The ESR2/
AG genotype (rs1952585) was prevalent in women who had a
child without treatment. The uterus is a primary target of
estrogen for various functions during the reproductive cycle
and pregnancy; estrogen activates a wide array of tissueand organ-speciﬁc physiologic responses by binding to its receptor, and modulating uterine events, preparing the endometrium for embryo attachment and implantation (31).
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes could modify

estrogen action, modifying the way the endocrine system acts
in the implantation process. Gene-array analysis revealed
more than 300 affected genes in patients with IVF failure,
8% of them being estrogen-dependent (32). We did not ﬁnd
any other study associating these polymorphisms and infertility, although its association has been already analyzed
with some others disorders, such as restrictive anorexia nervosa (33) and colorectal cancer (34).
In our previous study we found an association between
the LIF (rs929271) polymorphism and implantation efﬁciency
and pregnancy outcomes (35). In this study we strengthen
the information that women with the GG genotype have
more chance of becoming pregnant after the ﬁrst attempt of
IVF/ICSI, and women with the GT genotype tend to present
RIF.
Five of the six polymorphisms studied here were located
in intronic regions (TP63 rs12486772, VEGFA rs3025010,
MMP2 rs2287076, ESR1 rs12199722, and ESR2 rs1952
585). Evidence of different studies suggests that some intronic regions contain transcription factor binding sites
that may be important for the regulation of expression
and/or alternative splicing of the genes (36). This

untranslated regions affects cis-acting elements that control
messenger RNA stability, translation efﬁciency (including
micro-RNA biding sites), and messenger RNA localization
(37). The last polymorphism (LIF rs929271) was located in
the 30 untranslated region, which may affect the gene
expression, transcription factor biding, sequencing of RNA
that is noncoding, and gene splicing (38). Although we do
not know exactly the way each polymorphism acts, we
could see that they affect in some way the function of the
gene. Gene expression studies may help elucidate how
each of these polymorphisms may inﬂuence the action of
the genes.

Even though the VEGFA (rs3025010), MMP2 (rs2287076),
and ESR2 (rs1952585) polymorphisms showed signiﬁcant difference when analyzed separately, the association between
them and other polymorphisms studied here did not present
a signiﬁcant difference, and further studies with related genes
are necessary for a better understanding of this genetic
pathway that may inﬂuence endometrial receptivity. However, the association between the LIF (rs929271) and ESR1
(rs12199722) polymorphisms seemed to be signiﬁcantly
related to RIF, with a 7.9-fold increase in the chance of women
present RIF when compared with women with background of
successful IVF/ICSI treatment and 2.8-fold increase when

compared with women with spontaneous fertility. This association, after further studies to conﬁrm the results, could be used
as an extra tool by physicians to indicate alternative treatments, such as oocyte or embryo donation. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that shows that this association can inﬂuence the implantation process.
In conclusion, in this work we demonstrated that there is
an association between the ESR1 (rs12199722) and LIF
(rs929271) polymorphisms and women presenting RIF.
Although isolated SNPs were more signiﬁcant among women
with a background of RIF compared with women with spontaneous fertility, the ESR1/LIF association was stronger between women with a background of RIF compared with
women with a background of successful IVF/ICSI treatment.
Because the basic idea is to increase the chance of attaining
a correct diagnosis of RIF, further validation of this association is required (i.e., increasing the number of cases between
other fertility centers; expanding to different ethnic groups)
to provide more information regarding the potential use of
it. Additionally, the understanding of the way that each polymorphism acts in the implantation process would be enlightened with studies of gene expression.
