Combination) for Procedural Sedation and Analgesia in the
Emergency Department

From the University of British Columbia, Vancouver (Willman); and the Emergency Department,
Lions Gate Hospital, North Vancouver (Andolfatto), British Columbia, Canada.

Study objective: We evaluate the effectiveness and consider the safety of intravenous ketamine/
propofol combination (“ketofol”) in the same syringe for procedural sedation and analgesia in the
emergency department (ED).
Methods: A prospective case series of consecutive ketofol procedural sedation and analgesia events
in the ED of a trauma-receiving community teaching hospital from July 2005 to February 2006 was
studied. Patients of all ages, with any comorbid conditions, were included. Ketofol (1:1 mixture of
ketamine 10 mg/mL and propofol 10 mg/mL) was administered intravenously at the discretion of
the treating physician by using titrated aliquots. The presence or absence of adverse events was
documented, as were procedural success, recovery time, and physician, nurse, and patient
satisfaction. Physiologic data were recorded with established hospital procedural sedation and
analgesia guidelines.
Results: One hundred fourteen procedural sedation and analgesia events using ketofol were
performed for primarily orthopedic procedures. The median dose of medication administered was
ketamine at 0.75 mg/kg and propofol at 0.75 mg/kg (range 0.2 to 2.05 mg/kg each of propofol and
ketamine; interquartile range [IQR] 0.6 to 1.0 mg/kg). Procedures were successfully performed
without adjunctive sedatives in 110 (96.5%) patients. Three patients (2.6%; 95% confidence interval
[CI] 0.6% to 7.5%) had transient hypoxia; of these, 1 (0.9%; 95% CI 0.02% to 4.8%) required bagvalve-mask ventilation. Four patients (3.5%; 95% CI 1.0% to 8.7%) required repositioning for airway
malalignment, 4 patients (3.5%; 95% CI 1.0% to 8.7%) required adjunctive medication for sedation,
and 3 patients (2.6%; 95% CI 0.6% to 7.5%) had mild unpleasant emergence, of whom 1 (0.9%; 95%
CI 0.02% to 4.8%) received midazolam. No patient had hypotension or vomiting or received
endotracheal intubation. Median recovery time was 15 minutes (range 5 to 45 minutes; IQR 12 to
19 minutes). Median physician, nurse, and patient satisfaction scores were 10 on a 1-to-10 scale.
Conclusion: Ketofol procedural sedation and analgesia is effective and appears to be safe for painful
procedures in the ED. Few adverse events occurred and were either self-limited or responded to
minimal interventions. Recoveries were rapid, and staff and patients were highly satisfied. [Ann

Ketofol for Procedural Sedation and Analgesia
Editor’s Capsule Summary

What is already known on this topic
Ketamine and propofol are common agents for
emergency department (ED) procedural sedation and
analgesia; however, they are not traditionally used
together. In theory, the opposing hemodynamic and
respiratory effects of each drug might be complementary
and minimize overall adverse effects.
What question this study addressed
Ketamine and propofol were administered together at
doses of 0.75 mg/kg each (subdissociative for the former
and less than typical for the latter), in total doses at the
discretion of the practitioner in this case series.
What this study adds to our knowledge
So-called ketofol was highly effective in the 114
administrations described, and staff and patient
satisfaction was high. The few adverse effects were minor
and self-limited.
How this might change clinical practice
This study demonstrates that adding subdissociative
ketamine to propofol appears to be an acceptable
alternative regimen for ED procedural sedation and
analgesia. Studies directly comparing this regimen to
others will be needed to draw firm conclusions about
relative safety and efficacy.
Research we’d like to see
Given that the hemodynamic effects of ketamine seemed
to overbalance those of propofol, a study using less
ketamine in the mixture would help clarify the optimal
ratio.

ketamine as a single agent for procedural sedation and
analgesia in adults has been limited by the occurrence of
emergence phenomena and the concern of inducing vomiting
or laryngospasm.11-13
Ketamine and propofol administered in combination from
separate syringes has been used successfully in a variety of
settings, including sedation for spinal anesthesia,11 as well as for
gynecologic,14 opthamologic,15 and cardiovascular procedures
in adults10 and children.8 This combination has been favored
because of the opposing hemodynamic and respiratory effects of
each drug. Friedberg,16 in a prospective study of 1,264 patients
undergoing procedural sedation and analgesia for surgical
procedures with ketamine and propofol, concluded that this
combination was safe and effective. The use of ketamine in
conjunction with propofol has been shown to reduce the dose of
propofol required to achieve sedation,10 and this combination is
believed to result in less toxicity than either drug alone because
their complementary effects enable the use of lower doses of
each drug.8
24 Annals of Emergency Medicine

Willman & Andolfatto
Administering ketamine and propofol mixed in the same
syringe (so-called ketofol) has been shown to be efficacious in
the operating room and in ambulatory settings.8,15,17 Although
ketamine and propofol combined in the same syringe has been
described in the emergency department (ED) as an induction
regimen for rapid sequence intubation,18 there are no published
studies regarding their use together in the ED for procedural
sedation and analgesia.
Importance
Procedural sedation and analgesia for painful procedures is
the standard of care in emergency medicine and is commonly
performed using a variety of medication regimens, each
possessing particular advantages and disadvantages. Ketofol has
the potential to provide efficacious procedural sedation and
analgesia for painful procedures in the ED while minimizing the
adverse effects of either drug alone.
Goals of This Investigation
We wished to evaluate the effectiveness and consider the
safety of intravenous ketofol for procedural sedation and
analgesia in the ED. Secondary objectives included assessments
of recovery time and staff and patient satisfaction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Setting and Study Design
Our facility is a 250-bed community teaching hospital and
district trauma center with an annual census of 45,000
emergency patient visits. Consecutive patients who received
ketamine and propofol in the same syringe for procedural
sedation and analgesia were enrolled as a prospective case series
between July 2005 and February 2006. Procedural sedation and
analgesia events were captured through the attachment of a
special ketofol study data form to every mandatory procedural
sedation and analgesia clinical record. These forms were located
in the same single location where all medications used in the
ED for procedural sedation and analgesia were stored and
prepared for administration. ED staff was regularly queried to
ensure that forms were completed for all consecutive ketofol
patients. We did not systematically record the number of times
in which patients received propofol or ketamine alone for
procedural sedation and analgesia but estimate that the ketofol
patients represent approximately 75% of procedural sedation
and analgesia with either drug during the study period. This
study was approved by the hospital’s research and ethics
committee.
Selection of Participants
We included patients of all ages for whom the treating
physician selected ketofol for procedural sedation and analgesia.
The only absolute exclusion criterion was known allergy to
either study medication.
In accordance with the existing institutional procedural
sedation and analgesia guidelines, all procedures were performed

in a location that allowed continuous oxygen saturation and
cardiac monitoring and was equipped for emergency
resuscitation and airway management. All procedural sedation
and analgesia events required the attendance of a certified
emergency physician, registered nurse, and respiratory therapist.
Whenever possible, a second certified emergency physician
dedicated to the administration of the procedural sedation and
analgesia medication was also present.
Interventions
Ketofol was prepared as a 1:1 mixture of ketamine 10 mg/
mL and propofol 10 mg/mL mixed in a 10-mL or 20-mL
syringe fitted with a blunt-tip cannula. Procedural sedation and
analgesia using ketofol was performed by the intravenous
administration of 1- to 3-mL aliquots titrated at the discretion
of the physician administering the medication. The goal of
procedural sedation and analgesia was to attain deep or
dissociative sedation.19 Patients received opioid analgesia before
the procedure at the discretion of the treating physician. The
dose and timing of medication administration, as well as the
ultimate depth of sedation achieved, were intentionally not
standardized to more accurately reflect the variability in
physician preference, patient response, and the differing
procedural sedation and analgesia requirements for various
procedures in emergency medicine practice.
Methods of Measurement
The hospital’s standard procedural sedation and analgesia
record form was used for all procedures conducted and was
completed by the assisting registered nurse. The information
collected included presedation documentation of fasting time,
cardiorespiratory examination, body weight, and vital signs. The
provision of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula at 2 to 5 L
per minute was recommended but not required, and its use was
recorded. This form was also used to record medication doses
and times, vital signs during and after the procedure, and
discharge criteria.
On the separate ketofol data form, the treating physician
recorded comorbid conditions, adjunctive medications
administered (eg, opioid analgesics or additional sedation
medication), adverse events, and patient, nurse, and physician
satisfaction.
Data Collection and Processing
The nurse assisting with procedural sedation and analgesia
recorded vital signs before, during, and after each procedure
until specific discharge criteria were met. Discharge criteria
consisted of a 4-item scale (Figure); the total score must be
equal to or greater than 7 before completion of the protocol.
During each procedure, the treating physician documented
the presence or absence of an explicit list of adverse events on
the separate ketofol data form, including necessity for airway
intervention, apnea, hypotension, hypoxia, myoclonus,
seizure, rash, dysphoric emergence phenomena (agitation,

missing data were obtained from the patients’ hospital
records.
Outcome Measures
The dose of ketofol administered is described as the amount
of each of the ketamine and propofol components, reported in
milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Procedural sedation
and analgesia with ketofol was considered efficacious if the
required procedure was completed and no adjunctive
medications were required. Satisfaction ratings were recorded on
a 10-point scale, with zero being very unsatisfied and 10 being
completely satisfied. Recovery time was calculated as the time
from the last dose of medication given until discharge criteria
were met.
Vital sign changes were noted as the maximum variation
recorded during the procedure or recovery period compared
with preprocedural levels. Apnea was defined as cessation of
breathing for at least 20 seconds with or without oxygen

RESULTS
Characteristics of Study Patients
This study was conducted during an 8-month period in
which 114 patients had procedural sedation and analgesia with
ketofol for painful procedures in the ED. Patient demographics
and comorbid conditions are listed in Table 1. Supplemental
oxygen was used for 110 patients (97%). No patient was
hypoxic before procedural sedation and analgesia. The majority
of procedures performed were orthopedic (Table 2).
Main Results
The median dose of ketofol administered was 0.75 mg/kg
each of propofol and ketamine (range 0.20 to 2.05 mg/kg; IQR
0.6 to 1.0 mg/kg). Of the 114 procedures performed, 110
(96.5%) were completed successfully, with no adjunctive
medications required. Three patients (2.6%) required additional
doses of propofol alone to complete the intended procedure. For
1 patient (0.9%), the intended procedure (shoulder reduction)
was not successfully performed because of muscular rigidity
despite the use of 1.3 mg/kg each of ketamine and propofol and
an additional 1.4 mg/kg of propofol alone (Table 3).
Vital sign changes are summarized in Table 4, with most
patients experiencing modest increases in pulse rate and blood
pressure. No patient became hypotensive or had evidence of
poor perfusion. Eight patients (7%) had minor adverse events
(Table 3); the most common were 3 airway malalignments
(2.6%; 95% CI 0.6% to 7.5%), requiring simple repositioning
of the airway with jaw thrust or chin lift. Two patients (1.8%;

Significant adverse events are also described in Table 3.
Three patients (2.6%; 95% CI 0.6% to 7.5%) became hypoxic,
with 1 patient (0.9%; 95% CI 0.02% to 4.8%) requiring
assisted ventilation with bag-valve-mask for 2 minutes (lowest
oxygen saturation 86%). One patient (0.9%; 95% CI 0.02% to
4.8%) developed an unpleasant emergence reaction consisting
of agitation; he was treated with midazolam 0.025 mg/kg
intravenously, with prompt resolution of the event. No patients
were intubated. No sequelae were identified, and all patients
were discharged in good condition.
Median recovery time was 15.0 minutes (range 5 to 45
minutes; IQR 12 to 19 minutes). Eighty-three percent of
patients recovered in 20 minutes or sooner. Ninety-six percent
of patients recovered within 30 minutes.

was 10 (range 5 to 10; IQR 10 to 10).
Preprocedural analgesia was documented in 43 patients
(38%). Forty patients received intravenous morphine sulfate,
with the median total amount given equal to 0.073 mg/kg
(range 0.024 to 0.236 mg/kg; IQR 0.056 to 0.120 mg/kg). One
patient received fentanyl 0.38 ␮g/kg intravenously. One
pediatric patient received codeine phosphate at 1.5 mg/kg orally
3.5 hours before procedural sedation and analgesia. Two
patients received inhaled nitrous oxide.

LIMITATIONS
Ketofol was not directly compared with other known
procedural sedation and analgesia regimens; thus, it is
impossible to comment on its superiority over other regimens
in ED practice. The small size of this study limits the ability to
offer firm conclusions about the safety of ketofol as a procedural
sedation and analgesia agent.
Selection bias may exist in this series because only procedural
sedation and analgesia events using ketofol were recorded and
28 Annals of Emergency Medicine

the decision to use ketofol was at the discretion of the treating
physician. However, the number of patients receiving propofol
or ketamine alone outside of the study was relatively small, and
we believe the groups to be similar overall.
The reliance on oxygen saturation instead of capnography
may have led to underreporting of respiratory depression.
Capnography is known to be one of the earliest indicators of
respiratory depression,20 and preoxygenation of patients has
been shown to preserve oxygen saturation in the presence of
hypoventilation.21 All cases of hypoxia in our study occurred
among patients who did receive supplemental oxygen.
The dose and timing of sedative administration, as well as
the administration of preprocedural analgesics, was intentionally
not standardized. Although this strengthens the study in terms
of generalizability to actual practice, it also introduces variability
because premedication with narcotics and rapid administration
of larger doses of propofol are associated with increased
frequency and severity of respiratory complications.22,23

DISCUSSION
The use of propofol and ketamine as single agents for
procedural sedation and analgesia in the ED has grown in
popularity, but the unwanted effects of each drug alone have
limited their adoption in select populations. This study
represents a novel application of the combination of 2
well-known medications whose characteristics appear to be
complimentary. Our study shows ketofol to be an effective and
apparently safe ED procedural sedation and analgesia regimen.
The mixture of ketamine and propofol into a single syringe in a
1-to-1 ratio offers a simple, practical approach to medication
preparation and use. This series used ketofol on patients of all
ages and with a broad range of acute and chronic comorbid
conditions with a high degree of satisfaction, thus highlighting
its versatility in the ED setting.
The addition of ketamine to propofol is thought to
counteract the cardiorespiratory depression that occurs when
propofol is used alone, whereas propofol blunts the
psychomemetric and nauseant effects of ketamine. Ketamine
provides an analgesic effect that is absent when propofol is used
alone, which, for some clinicians, may represent a further
advantage. Using ketamine and propofol in combination allows
sedation to be achieved with lower total doses of each drug,
resulting in favorable adverse event and recovery time profiles.
Short recovery time is a valuable attribute of a procedural
sedation and analgesia regimen in the ED environment. The
median recovery time of 15 minutes in our study is comparable
to that of other procedural sedation and analgesia regimens
noted for their rapid recovery times. Only 4% of patients
showed a recovery time longer than 30 minutes. Studies of
propofol sedation report recovery times from 15⫾11 minutes24
to 23⫾11 minutes.25 Mean recovery times from etomidate have
been reported between 12.6⫾10 minutes26 and 17.0⫾10.1
minutes.27 Studies of fentanyl/midazolam combination have
shown recovery times from 28.5 minutes28 to 113.7⫾36.9

is used alone.
In this study, adverse effects with ketofol were uncommon
and had no apparent relationship to drug dosages or to the use
of preprocedural medications. There were no cases of
hypotension, bradycardia, vomiting, or laryngospasm. At
discharge, no patient demonstrated sequelae from any adverse
event.
Of the 3 patients experiencing hypoxia, all received
supplemental oxygen before and during the procedure, 1
received narcotic analgesics before the procedure, and 1 patient
was acutely intoxicated with alcohol while undergoing
procedural sedation and analgesia. No patient required
intubation. The rate of hypoxia in our study is comparable to
that of reports in the literature of sedation with propofol alone
that showed that hypoxia occurred in 5% of patients and bagvalve-mask assist was required in 0.8%.32 The incidence of
hypoxia with etomidate has been shown to be 4%, with bagvalve-mask ventilation required in 3% of cases.27 The incidence
of respiratory depression using fentanyl and midazolam has been
reported to be 19%.33 Studies of ketamine sedation report
apnea and hypoxia to be rare, usually occurring with rapid
intravenous administration.12,13
Emergence reactions and vomiting are considered to be
significant adverse effects of ketamine usage, occurring more
often in adults than children.34 In a study of 1,022 pediatric
patients, Green et al13 reported emesis in 6.7%, mild emergence
in 17.6%, and moderate to severe agitation in 1.6% of patients.
Chudnofsky et al35 described emergence phenomena in up to
50% of adults. In our study, all 3 cases of emergence
phenomena occurred in adults, and of these, only 1 was treated
with midazolam. According to the expected rate of occurrence
of emergence phenomena in adults described in the literature,
our results suggest that ketofol may be associated with a lower
rate of unpleasant emergence than ketamine alone.
As with most procedural sedation and analgesia regimens,
ketofol was not 100% effective, which may reflect variations in
the dosing between physicians, as well as individual variability
in sedative response. In the 4 cases of inadequate sedation in our
series, additional propofol alone enabled successful completion
of the intended procedure in all but 1 patient (shoulder
reduction). This single patient exhibited muscular rigidity, a
known effect of ketamine,34 resulting in the abandonment of
procedural sedation and analgesia with ketofol. This patient
subsequently had procedural sedation and analgesia with
fentanyl and midazolam and successful completion of the
intended procedure. Two other patients exhibited muscular
rigidity that did not interfere with the successful completion
of the necessary procedures (incision and drainage, knee
manipulation).
Further research with larger samples comparing ketofol to
other common procedural sedation and analgesia agents could
further document the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of
ketamine and propofol combination for procedural sedation and

analgesia in the ED setting. Different ratios of ketamine and
propofol (eg, propofol 70%:ketamine 30%) may provide safe,
deep sedation with cardiorespiratory stability, greater relaxation,
and lower incidences of emergence phenomena.
We found the combination of ketamine and propofol in a
single syringe to be easy to use and highly effective as a
procedural sedation and analgesia agent in the ED setting,
which is reflected in the high degree of satisfaction recorded by
physicians, nurses, and patients. The relatively small size of our
study precludes conclusions about safety and the incidence of
rare adverse effects. As with all procedural sedation and
analgesia regimens, adverse effects are possible, and thus,
appropriate monitoring and the ability to intervene with
cardiorespiratory support remain essential.
