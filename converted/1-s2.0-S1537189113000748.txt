Steroid hormones are well-recognized suppressors of the inﬂammatory response, however, their cell- and
tissue-speciﬁc effects in the regulation of inﬂammation are far less understood, particularly for the sexrelated steroids. To determine the contribution of progesterone in the endothelium, we have characterized
and validated an in vitro culture system in which human umbilical vein endothelial cells constitutively
express human progesterone receptor (PR). Using next generation RNA-sequencing, we identiﬁed a selective
group of cytokines that are suppressed by progesterone both under physiological conditions and during pathological activation by lipopolysaccharide. In particular, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL2/3, and CXCL1 were found to be direct
targets of PR, as determined by ChIP-sequencing. Regulation of these cytokines by progesterone was also
conﬁrmed by bead-based multiplex cytokine assays and quantitative PCR. These ﬁndings provide a novel
role for PR in the direct regulation of cytokine levels secreted by the endothelium. They also suggest that
progesterone-PR signaling in the endothelium directly impacts leukocyte trafﬁcking in PR-expressing tissues.

1. Introduction
Inﬂammation contributes to the susceptibility and progression of
many diseases that exhibit gender based differences in prevalence.
These include, but are not limited to, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease and sexually transmitted infections (Kaushic et al., 2011;
McCombe et al., 2009; Meyer et al., 2006). The prevailing hypothesis
is that endocrine–immune interactions drive this sexual dimorphism
by affecting the sensitivity to various inﬂammatory stimuli. Evidence
for this emanates from studies demonstrating the requirement for the
immune system in hormonally controlled processes including implantation, cycling, and pregnancy (Challis et al., 2009; Gilliver, 2010;
Jones, 2004; King and Critchley, 2010; Red-Horse and Drake, 2004;
van Mourik et al., 2009). For example, symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis are reduced during pregnancy, suggesting that
hormones not only modulate local inﬂammatory reactions, but also can
affect systemic immune responses as well (Adams Waldorf and Nelson,
2008; Hughes, 2012; Martocchia et al., 2011). While much is known of

the cellular and molecular control of the immune system by estrogen,
glucocorticoids, and androgen signaling, the action of progesterone
and its downstream targets are far less understood.
Progesterone has been generally assumed to play an antiinﬂammatory role in immune regulation. In fact, the physiological
reduction of progesterone prior to menstruation and preceding labor
results in a marked inﬂux of inﬂammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells) into the decidua resembling a local inﬂammatory response (Hamilton et al., 2012, 2013; Jones, 2004; Shynlova et al., 2008).
Moreover, mice with complete deletion of PR (PRKO) were found to
have increased immune cell inﬁltration into the uterus and impaired
thymic function (Tibbetts et al., 1999a, 1999b). At the cellular level, PR
expression has been demonstrated in a variety of immune cell types
indicative of a direct regulation by progesterone (Butts et al., 2008;
Gilliver, 2010; Hughes, 2012). However, these ﬁndings do not explain
progesterone control of other leukocyte populations that do not express
PR in vivo, such as natural killer cells and granulocytes. Therefore, it is
likely that paracrine factors such as cytokines and chemokines act as
effectors of steroid hormones, thus enabling systemic immune modulation in the absence of leukocyte steroid receptors. In fact, there is ample
evidence in the literature for regulation of immune function by progesterone through its effect on smooth muscle, stromal, and perivascular
cells (Gotkin et al., 2006; Hardy et al., 2006; Luk et al., 2010; Shields et
al., 2005; Shynlova et al., 2008). Due to its multiple cellular targets, a
comprehensive dissection of cell speciﬁc signaling, as well as direct
downstream targets of PR, is necessary to understand the multiple
immune-modulatory functions of progesterone.

The endothelium is an active participant in immune cell trafﬁcking
and is an important barrier in the regulation of leukocyte extravasation into tissues (Ley et al., 2007; Pober and Sessa, 2007). Upon activation by an inﬂammatory stimulus, endothelial cells acquire new
capabilities including cytokines/chemokine secretion and the expression of endothelial–leukocyte adhesion molecules (Pober and Sessa,
2007). Several reports have demonstrated expression of PR within
different human vascular beds (Ingegno et al., 1988; Iruela-Arispe
et al., 1999; Krikun et al., 2005; Maybin and Duncan, 2004; PerrotApplanat et al., 1995; Rodríguez-Manzaneque et al., 2000), including
endothelial cells of human atherosclerotic vessels (Vázquez et al.,
1999). Functionally, progesterone has been found to mediate endothelial cell proliferation, transcriptional repression of endothelial–
leukocyte adhesion molecules, as well as MMP secretion (Otsuki et
al., 2001; Rodríguez-Manzaneque et al., 2000; Vázquez et al., 1999)
implicating a direct function of progesterone in the endothelium.
Therefore, we hypothesized that progesterone signaling may modulate the immune system by transcriptionally altering endothelial cell
activation and expression of immunomodulatory factors.
Here we provide evidence that PR signaling in the endothelium
directly regulates cytokine expression both under physiological
conditions, as well as following an acute inﬂammatory stimulus. PR
is able to selectively and directly target a cohort of endothelial cytokines resulting in transcriptional repression and reduction in protein
levels by the endothelium. These ﬁndings expand our understanding
of the cell speciﬁc function of progesterone in the endothelium and its
potential role in immune regulation through direct mediation of
cytokine production.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Virus production and transduction
Human PR cDNA was PCR ampliﬁed and cloned into a lentiviral
vector using the following primers with attached restriction site
sequences: 5′-PR-Xbal (GCTATCTAGAATGACTGAGCTGAAGGCA) and 3′PR-STOP-EcoRI (GCTAGAATTCCTACTTTTTATGAAAGAGAAG). Lentivirusbased vectors encoding PR cDNA were generated by transient
cotransfection of 293 T cells with a three-plasmid combination, as
described previously, with slight modiﬁcations (Naldini et al., 1996).
The construct pMD.G was used for the production of the VSV-G viral
envelope in combination with the packaging constructs pMDLg/pRRE
and pRSV-REV, whereas the pRRL constructions correspond to the
different transfer vectors. Brieﬂy, 100 mm dishes of nonconﬂuent
293 T cells were co-transfected with 6.5 μg of pMDLg/pRRE, 3.5 μg of
pMDG (encoding the VSV-G envelope), 2.5 μg of pRSV-REV and 10 μg
of pRRL-hPR, by the CaPi-DNA coprecipitation method (Chen and
Okayama, 1987; Sakoda et al., 1992). The plasmid vectors were provided by Dr Luigi Naldini (University of Torino, Italy). Next day, the medium was adjusted to make a ﬁnal concentration of 10 mM sodium
butyrate and the cells were incubated for 8 h to obtain high-titer virus
production as previously described (Sakoda et al., 1999). Conditioned
medium was harvested 16 h later and passed through 0.45 mm ﬁlters.
Viral titer was determined by assessing viral p24 antigen concentration
by ELISA (the Alliance® HIV-I p24 ELISA Kit, Perkin Elmer) and hereafter
expressed as μg of p24 equivalent units per milliliter.
2.2. Cell culture
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in MCDB131 media (VEC Technologies, Rensselaer, NY) supplemented with
charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientiﬁc, Tarzana,
CA). For bead-based multiplex cytokine arrays, HUVECs were grown
to conﬂuence in 48 well plates and treated with LPS (1 μM; 0111:
B4; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and/or progesterone (100 nM; Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) for 4, 8, and 24 h. Media without serum were collected,

37

and run in triplicate on a 42-plex array analyzed by Eve Technologies.
For immunocytochemistry, HUVECs were seeded onto Lab-Tek II
8-well chamber slides (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rochester, NY) and ﬁxed
with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were probed with an antibody
against PR (1:400; clone SP2, Lab Vision, Kalamazoo, MI) followed
by an Alexa Fluor secondary (1:300, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY).
Nuclei were stained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI,
1:1000; Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Images were acquired using a
Zeiss LSM 520 multiphoton microscope (Zeiss, Germany).
2.3. Immunoblotting
Total HUVEC lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and nitrocellulose membranes (Optitran BA-S 83; Dassel, Germany) were incubated
overnight with an anti-PR antibody (1:2000; clone SP2, Lab Vision,
Kalamazoo, MI) and anti-GAPDH antibody (1:1000, Millipore, Billerica,
MA). Blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary (1:5000;
Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and developed using Supersignal
West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Kalamazoo,
MI). A Bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+ and accompanying Image Lab software
was used for detection (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).
2.4. RNA isolation, qPCR, and library preparation
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript First-strand Synthesis
System (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). qPCR was performed using
SYBR Green reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and PCR products were
run on an Opticon2 PCR machine (MJ Research; BioRad, Hercules,
CA). Libraries for RNA-sequencing were generated using an Illumina
Multiplex System (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced using
HIseq-2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). RNA-seq datasets have been
deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus with the accession
number GSE46502.
2.5. RNA-seq analysis
Multiplex runs were debarcoded by in house Unix shell script.
Reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using TopHat
v2.0.4 (Trapnell et al., 2009) and processed with Cufﬂinks v2.0.1
(Trapnell et al., 2010). Assemblies for all samples were merged
using CuffMerge and pairwise differential expression was assessed
using Cuffdiff. Genes with a p-value smaller than 0.01 where considered signiﬁcant. Heatmaps with relative expression were generated
by visualizing the log2 values of each gene rpkm divided with the average rpkm of all samples using Java treeview (de Hoon et al., 2004).
2.6. ChIP-sequencing and analysis
HUVECs were infected with hPR lentivirus, grown to conﬂuence,
and treated with progesterone for 1 h. For each condition (noninfected-negative control, PR + P, PR only, and IgG control)
10 × 106 cultured HUVECs were used per IP. Cells were crosslinked
with 1% formaldehyde, resuspended in 400 μL of lysis buffer (1%
SDS, 20 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0)) containing protease inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), and sonicated to achieve
200 bp fragments. Samples were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of
anti-PR or IgG antibody. Protein A Dynabeads (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY) were used to isolate antibody–PR complexes and eluted
using 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0. Crosslinks were reversed by incubation at 65 °C and DNA was puriﬁed using Qiagen MinElute Columns.
Libraries were generated using Ovation Ultralow IL Multiplex System
1–8 (Nugen, San Carlos, CA) and sequenced using HIseq-2000
(Illumina, San Diego, CA). ChIP-seq data sets have been deposited in
the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus with the accession number
GSE43786.

Multiplex runs were debarcoded using Fastx toolkit (http://
hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit) and reads were mapped to the
human genome (hg19) using bowtie v0.12.7 (Langmead et al., 2009).
12–22 million uniquely mapped reads were obtained for each sample.
Peak identiﬁcation was performed with MACS v1.3.7.1 (Zhang et al.,
2008). Peaks were called by comparing peaks in PR and PR + P conditions to that of the input, negative control (non-infected cells) or IgG
control. Only peaks that appeared in all three comparisons were
determined to be noteworthy. Genes potentially regulated by PR were
determined by mapping peaks to nearby genes within 200 kb of the
transcriptional start site using the Genomic Regions Enrichment of
Annotations Tool (McLean et al., 2010). Intersection of PR binding
associated genes with differentially expressed genes was performed
using Unix shell scripts.
2.7. Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using a Student unpaired two-tailed t-test.
p-Values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Generation and validation of a lentivirus for expression of human PR
A detailed, comprehensive histological examination of PR expression in the mouse conﬁrmed the presence of PR in the endothelium
(Fig. 1A). Interestingly, PR positive endothelial cells were restricted
to veins, but absent from arteries. Although expressed by different
vascular beds in humans, endothelial PR expression in the mouse
was restricted to the vasculature of the uterus, suggestive of its
unique importance in this organ.
In order to gain a better molecular understanding of progesterone
function in the endothelium, we overexpressed human PR in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using lentiviral infection.
Full-length human PR cDNA (hPR) was cloned downstream of a
CMV promoter and preceding sequences for eGFP and puromycin
resistance (Fig. 1B). A lentivirus expressing eGFP under the control
of a CMV promoter was used as a control. HUVECs overexpressing
the GFP or hPR construct looked morphologically normal when compared to uninfected HUVECs (Fig. 1C). PR protein colocalized with
GFP positive cells, conﬁrming GFP as an indicator of PR expressing
cells (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis demonstrated the expression
of both PR isoforms, PR-A and PR-B, in HUVECs expressing hPR, but
not in cells expressing GFP alone (Fig. 1E). PR protein levels were
most optimally expressed at viral concentrations between 0.16 and
0.13 μg/mL, while higher concentrations led to cell death and reduction
in PR protein expression.
HUVECs expressing hPR were treated with progesterone to evaluate the ability of the transduced receptor to respond to progesterone
(Fig. 2A). Consistent with previous reports, PR was mainly localized to
the nucleus in both the presence and absence of progesterone, but
was almost exclusively localized to the nucleus following progesterone treatment (Fig. 2A). To determine the optimal infection efﬁciency
of the hPR lentivirus, cells were infected with progressively lower
viral concentrations. Titration of virus demonstrated that concentrations less than 0.16 μg/mL led to a reduction of PR expressing cells
upon quantiﬁcation (Fig. 2B). Therefore, all subsequent experiments
were performed at an hPR lentiviral concentration of 0.16 μg/mL.
3.2. PR negatively regulates endothelial cytokine production
Using next generation RNA sequencing, we explored whether PR
signaling may transcriptionally alter the expression of cytokines by
the endothelium. First, we assessed which cytokines might be speciﬁcally altered when lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was applied to endothelial cultures for 4 and 8 h. A total of 70 cytokines were included in

the initial analysis. Of these 70, only 27 showed transcript expression by the endothelium (Fig. 3A), and only 15 of these were significantly (p b 0.01) altered in the presence of LPS at both 4 and 8 h of
treatment (Fig. 3B). To determine if progesterone altered the expression of these 15 genes, we examined fold change expression between HUVECs in the presence of LPS alone and those treated
concurrently with LPS and progesterone (Fig. 3B). Although majority of these cytokines were downregulated by progesterone, only
ﬁve: including CCL2, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1 and CXCL2, were considered
to be statistically signiﬁcant (p b 0.01). To assess whether progesterone alone, in the absence of LPS, was able to reduce the expression of these same ﬁve genes, we compared fold change expression
between hPR infected cells in the presence or absence of
progesterone for 4 h (Fig. 3C). Even in the absence of LPS, progesterone still negatively regulated the expression of IL-8, IL-6, CXCL1, and
CXCL1/2, suggesting that progesterone may modulate cytokine production in the absence of an acute inﬂammatory stimulus.

replicates.

3.3. PR binding peaks reveal direct transcriptional regulation of cytokine
production
To further explore whether PR could directly regulate cytokine expression, we obtained a global read-out of PR binding sites in the
HUVEC genome using ChIP-sequencing. Activation of the receptor
by progesterone resulted in 9906 PR binding sites. To identify whether the 5 cytokines signiﬁcantly regulated by progesterone might
be direct targets of PR, it was necessary to combine the ChIP-seq
and RNA-seq datasets. RNA-seq analysis of HUVECs yielded 431
downregulated genes with a p-value less than 0.01. These genes
were then intersected with the list of 3886 genes predicted as
regulated by the PR binding sites obtained from ChIP-seq evaluation.
The analysis revealed 214 genes that were likely directly repressed by

PR. Of this list, 4 out of the 5 cytokines found to be downregulated by
progesterone were also predicted to be direct targets of PR (Fig. 3C).

3.4. PR negatively regulates cytokine production by the endothelium
To conﬁrm whether treatment of the endothelium with progesterone leads to a reduction in cytokine secretion, we performed a
42-multiplex bead-based cytokine array. This approach was set up
to determine whether reduced RNA transcript levels correlated with
cytokine protein production. Of the 42 cytokines analyzed, only 24
were at sufﬁciently high levels to be detected by the array (Table 1).
Analysis of these 24 cytokines uncovered selective regulation of 8
by progesterone, including fractalkine, GRO, IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1,
PDGF-AA, and PDGFAB/BB. Cytokine regulation was PR-dependent
as per evaluation of HUVECs transduced with a GFP control construct.
These ﬁndings were very similar to the RNA- and ChIP-seq analyses,
as IL-6, IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, and CXCL1/GRO were all found to be targets
of PR (Fig. 3C).

3.5. Conﬁrmation of cytokine transcript levels following
progesterone treatment
In order to conﬁrm the ﬁndings from the global transcriptome
analysis and the multiplex cytokine array, we more closely examined
protein and transcript levels following concurrent exposure of
HUVECs to progesterone and LPS (Figs. 4–6). As predicted, the protein
levels for IL-6 were signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of progesterone (Fig. 4A). This correlated with a signiﬁcant decrease in transcript
levels as early as 1 h after progesterone treatment (Fig. 4B).
IL-8/CXCL8 showed a similar expression pattern to that of IL-6, but
regulation by progesterone was not as pronounced (Fig. 5A, D).
CXCL10/IP-10 RNA levels were negatively regulated by progesterone
at early time points, yet protein levels were not signiﬁcantly reduced
until 24 h after treatment (Fig. 5B, E). Interestingly, transcript levels
of CXCL1/GRO were signiﬁcantly downregulated by progesterone at
very early time points of 1 and 2 h (Fig. 5F). This correlated with a reduction in protein at 4 and 8 h, yet this phenomenon did not extend
to 24 h (Fig. 5C).
Progesterone signiﬁcantly reduced RNA levels of the CCL family
member, MCP-1/CCL2, yet decreased protein levels did not reach significance (Fig. 6A, C). Alternatively, the CX3C family member, CX3CL1/
fractalkine, although not found to be signiﬁcantly reduced by RNA-seq
analysis, did show signiﬁcant reduction in both RNA and protein expression at all times of progesterone treatment (Fig. 6B, D).
4. Discussion
Hormones are believed to play an important role in the sexual
dimorphism underlying diseases with immune etiologies (Gilliver,
2010; Hughes, 2012; Martocchia et al., 2011). Clearly interdependence
exists between different hormonal signaling pathways in immune regulation, yet this complexity makes it difﬁcult to assess the contributions
of individual steroid hormones, particularly in vivo. Although several
studies have demonstrated the anti-inﬂammatory properties of progesterone within the context of its reproductive functions (Challis et al.,
2009; Gilliver, 2010; Jones, 2004; King and Critchley, 2010; Red-Horse
and Drake, 2004; van Mourik et al., 2009), little is understood as to its
direct cellular and molecular targets with respect to immune regulation.
As the vascular endothelium is known to mediate leukocyte homing
and selective extravasation, we hypothesized that progesterone
signaling might transcriptionally modulate the activation state of the
endothelium in response to an acute inﬂammatory stimulus. Using unbiased global expression analysis we demonstrated that progesterone
signaling, via PR, directly suppresses a select group of cytokine and
chemokines expressed by the endothelium. This reduction was seen
both under physiological and pathological activation by LPS, indicating

that endothelial cells are also susceptible to anti-inﬂammatory regulation by progesterone.
Our results indicate that under homeostatic conditions, endothelial
expression of PR is selective to veins and conspicuously absent from arteries. This exquisite speciﬁcity is consistent with the fact that immune
trafﬁcking occurs predominantly in venules and lymphatics (Pober and
Sessa, 2007). Thus, restricted expression allows spatial regulation of PR
function in response to a systemically distributed ligand. Although PR is
not constitutively expressed in the endothelium, its focal and sporadic
expression may be indicative of a tightly regulated and precisely localized function. Although not much is known of the role of PR in the
endothelium, a select group of in vitro studies have shown that PR can
inhibit the expression of the endothelial–leukocyte adhesion molecule,
VCAM-1, and the cytokines IL-8 and MCP-1 (Okada et al., 1998; Otsuki
et al., 2001; Simoncini, 2004), yet no study has assessed global expression of endothelial genes upon progesterone stimulation.
To examine the contribution of PR in the vascular endothelium at
the molecular level, we employed a cell culture based system using
HUVECs. Using global transcriptome analysis we examined cytokine
production from the endothelium in the presence of LPS. Of 70 cytokines examined, 29 of these displayed altered expression in the presence of LPS, yet only 15 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. From
these, 5 were signiﬁcantly downregulated by progesterone (IL-8, IL-6,
CCL2, CXCL1 and CXCL2/3) while 4 (IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CXCL2)
were directly bound by PR. These ﬁndings are intriguing as not only
does the endothelium itself preferentially produce a unique subset
of cytokines in response to LPS, but only a small proportion of these
are presumably controlled by PR. Therefore, progesterone may modulate speciﬁc leukocyte subsets in response to an acute inﬂammatory
event. Indeed, the majority of the direct cytokine/chemokine targets
of progesterone noted in this study were found to be neutrophil/
monocyte attractants (Hamilton et al., 2012; Romano et al., 1997).
Biologically, the local tissue response to withdrawal of progesterone shows many features characteristic of an inﬂammatory response
(Gilliver, 2010; King and Critchley, 2010; Oertelt-Prigione, 2012).
Following progesterone decline in the circulation that precedes menstruation, there is a signiﬁcant inﬂux of neutrophils, eosinophils, and
macrophages into the uterus, which are likely critical for focal inﬂammatory mediated endometrial repair (Henriet et al., 2012). Analysis
of whole decidual tissue has implicated MCP-1, IL-8, IL-6, MDC,
fractalkine, eotaxin, and MCP-3 following the decline in progesterone
levels that initiate menstruation (Angstwurm et al., 1997; Critchley et
al., 1999; Hamilton et al., 2013; Hannan et al., 2004; Jones, 2004;
Jones et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2000). Moreover, IL-8 and MCP-1
levels as well as monocyte numbers are increased in human decidua
from women taking the PR inhibitor, mifepristone (Critchley et al.,
1996). Furthermore, the expression of these two cytokines (both in

vitro and in vivo) was inhibited by progesterone (Jones et al., 1997;
Kelly et al., 1994; Loudon et al., 2003; Luk et al., 2010).
Similar to menstruation, proinﬂammatory cytokines also play a
central role in the mechanisms of term and inﬂammation/infectioninduced preterm parturition (Hamilton et al., 2013; MacIntyre et al.,
2012; Norman et al., 2007). Cytokines associated with this process
also include MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-6, in addition to RANTES, and
MIP-B1 (Hamilton et al., 2012, 2013; Robertson et al., 2010). As progesterone is capable of inhibiting the expression of MCP-1, IL-8, and
IL-6 in the endothelium, it is possible that the vasculature plays a
critical role in maintaining an immunosuppressive environment in
the uterus prior to these immune-mediated events. Naturally, other
cell types, including stromal and epithelial cells also play key roles
in immune regulation (Hamilton et al., 2013).
Interestingly, we determined that GRO/CXCL1/2/3 is a direct target
of progesterone in the endothelium, yet a role for GRO has not been
revealed with regard to reproductive immune inﬁltration. Recently,
progesterone has been found to inhibit expression of GRO in ovarian
and endometrial cancer cells as well as dendritic cells (Kavandi et al.,
2012; Zhao et al., 2013). As GRO is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, more so than IL-8, suppression of GRO by progesterone may play
an even stronger role in the inhibition of neutrophil trafﬁcking.
To conﬁrm that progesterone mediated changes in RNA expression correlated with differential protein production, we performed
an unbiased bead-based multiplex cytokine array. While all of the

cytokines determined to be transcriptionally modulated following
RNA-seq analysis were regulated at the protein level, two additional
cytokines, fractalkine/CX3CL1 and CXCL10/IP-10, were also found to
be downregulated following analysis of the multiplex array. Subsequent qPCR analysis conﬁrmed this reduction at the RNA level.
Based on our analysis of the RNA-seq data, CXCL10 did not meet
the criteria as being signiﬁcantly regulated by LPS, and thus was excluded from further evaluation. In addition, although LPS signiﬁcantly
modulated CX3CL1 expression, it was not signiﬁcantly altered by progesterone. It is likely that these two cytokines are targets of progesterone, but due to the stringent statistical analysis used for our
RNA-seq datasets these cytokines were not found to be signiﬁcant.
5. Conclusion
The results of this study provide detailed insight into the endothelial cell speciﬁc role of progesterone signaling in the regulation of
cytokine production. PR directly suppresses the expression of a small
subset of cytokines both under physiological conditions and following
stimulation by LPS. These results conﬁrm PR as an anti-inﬂammatory
agent in the endothelium, with potential for the negative regulation of
immune cell trafﬁcking into tissues. Understanding the factors and
cell populations that control immune cells will further clarify gender
differences in disease as well as dysregulated immune-mediated reproductive processes such as preterm labor.
