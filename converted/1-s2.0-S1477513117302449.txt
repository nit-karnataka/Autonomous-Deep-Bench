Summary
Introduction
With advancements in endoscopic surgery, open
surgical techniques for urinary system stones have
paved the way for the application of less invasive
treatment modalities in patients with pediatric kidney stone disease. These treatment options include
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL),
percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS).
Objective
We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of RIRS
and micro-PCNL techniques in the surgical treatment of kidney stones in pediatric patients.
Study design
A total of 48 pediatric patients, who underwent RIRS
or micro-PERC for pediatric kidney stone disease,
were retrospectively analyzed. Urinalysis, urine
culture, serum creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone,
24-hour urine sample, complete blood count (CBC),
urinary system X-ray, kidney ureter bladder (KUB),
and urinary system ultrasonography (USG) test results were evaluated prior to the procedure. Intravenous pyelography (IVP), non-contrast computed
tomography (CT), and renal scintigraphy evaluations
were also performed, if necessary. The patients
were divided into two groups: micro-PERC group

Table

(n Z 25) and RIRS group (n Z 23). Data relating to
the duration of the operation, duration of fluoroscopy, length of hospitalization, complication rates,
and stone-free rates were recorded.
Results
The mean ages of the micro-PERC and RIRS groups
were 4  2.3 and 10.9  3 years, respectively
(p Z 0.001). However, the mean stone sizes were
12.2  2.8 and 13.7  3.5 mm, respectively
(p > 0.05). The mean duration of operation was
75.1  18.9 min in the micro-PERC group and
62.3  15.3 min in the RIRS group (p > 0.05). In
addition, the mean duration of fluoroscopy was
115  35.4 s in the micro-PERC group and
39.9  15.3 s in the RIRS group. The stone-free rates
in the micro-PERC and RIRS groups following the
procedure were reported to be 84% (21/25) and
82.6% (19/23), respectively (p > 0.05). In terms of
the degree of preoperative hydronephrosis between
the groups, the rates of mild and moderateesevere
disease were 76% (19 out of 25) and 24% (6 out of
25), and 69.5% (16 out of 23) and 30.4% (7 out of 23)
in the micro-PERC and RIRS groups, respectively.
Conclusion
In recent years, technological developments in
minimally invasive procedures, such as micro-PERC
and RIRS, have facilitated choices made by urologists in the effective and safe first-line treatment in
pediatric patients.

Introduction
Pediatric urinary system stone disease is endemic and
frequently encountered in Turkey and certain regions of the
Far East with an incidence ranging from 0.1% to 5% [1]. The
recurrence risk has been reported to increase in case of
comorbidities, such as anatomical and metabolic abnormalities and infectious diseases [2]. With the advancements in
endoscopic surgery, open surgical techniques for the urinary
system stones have paved the way for the application of less
invasive treatment modalities in patients with pediatric
kidney stone disease. These treatment options include
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), percutaneous
nephrolithotomy (PCNL), and retrograde intrarenal surgery
(RIRS) [1]. Since 2007, the use of RIRS for the treatment of
pediatric kidney stones has particularly increased [3].
Micro-PCNL, which has been developed in parallel with
the technological developments in urologic surgery, is
applied differently from the standard PCNL and mini-PCNL
techniques. First described by Bader et al. [4] in 2010 at the
American Urology Association (AUA) meeting held in San
Francisco, micro-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (microPERC), or the all-seeing needle technique as it is otherwise
known, has many advantages, such as being conducted
under the direct visual guidance, single and correct calyx
accessibility, and no need for dilatation or multiple maneuvers. Therefore, the duration of both the operation and
the fluoroscopy can be shortened, and complications, such
as bleeding and perforation, which may develop during the
dilatation stage, are avoided [5].
Currently, the main goal of the surgical treatment of
pediatric kidney stone diseases is to remove the stones
using minimally invasive procedures while preventing any
injury by the stones (calculi) to the urinary system, and to
prevent the recurrence of the calculi. In this study, we
aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of RIRS and
micro-PCNL techniques in the surgical treatment of kidney
stones in pediatric patients.

Materials and methods
A total of 48 pediatric patients who underwent RIRS or
micro-PERC for pediatric kidney stone disease between
January 2015 and April 2016 were retrospectively analyzed.
Urinalysis, urine culture, serum creatinine (Cr), blood urea
nitrogen (BUN), calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, 24-hour urine sample, complete blood count (CBC),
urinary system X-ray, kidney ureter bladder (KUB), and
urinary system ultrasonography (USG) test results were
evaluated prior to the procedure. Intravenous pyelography
(IVP), non-contrast computed tomography (CT), and renal
scintigraphy evaluations were also performed, if necessary.
The patients were divided into two groups: micro-PERC
group (n Z 25) and RIRS group (n Z 23). Children of school
age underwent RIRS in the presence of retro-colon and
abnormal rotation of the kidney, whereas micro-PERC was
used in preschool children in whom the renal access sheath
entry was considered to be inadequate. Following the
procedure, stone-free rates were evaluated with KUB in
opaque stones, or Ultrasonography (USG) in non-opaque
stones, at postoperative week 2.

H. Sen et al.
Data relating to the duration of the operation, duration
of fluoroscopy, length of hospitalization, complication
rates, and stone-free rates were recorded. The Clavien
complication classification system [6] was used to assess
the complications.
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The study protocol was approved by the institutional
Ethics Committee.

Micro-PERC technique
Under general anesthesia and in the lithotomy position, a
3F ureteralcystoscope-guided catheter was advanced to the
renal pelvis through the ureteral orifice. A 16-gauge allseeing needle (PolyDiagnost, Germany) under fluoroscopic
guidance was inserted into the stone-containing calyx or
pelvis, in the prone position. A three-path connector was
attached to the proximal end. One of the lateral channels
of the connector was used as a telescope and the other for
the irrigation. In addition, a laser fiber was directed from
the central channel. The holmium: yttrium aluminum
garnet (Ho:YAG) laser (AMS StoneLight Holmium Laser System, Brookfield, WI, USA) was used as the lithotripsy tool.
The ureteral catheter was removed within 12e24 h
following the fragmentation of the stones. The stone particles were then left to pass spontaneously.

Retrograde intrarenal surgery technique
A 0.035-inch safety guide was placed in the renal pelvis,
accompanied by cystoscopy or rigid ureterorenoscopy (URS)
and under the fluoroscopic or direct visual guidance, in the
lithotomy position under general anesthesia. The ureteral
access sheath (9.5/11.5F, 35 cm, Boston Scientific, Natick,
MA, USA) was advanced through this guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance. The stone was accessed at its site
through a flexible URS (Olympus URF-P6, Singapore), and
fragmented using a Ho:YAG laser (StoneLight Laser Therapy
System). No routine basket extraction was performed for
residual fragments. At the discretion of the surgeon, a JJ
stent was applied at the end of the operation and extracted
within approximately 10e14 days.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS v11.5
software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The chi-s test was
used to evaluate the success rate and postoperative complications between the groups, and the ManneWhitney U test
was used to assess the length of hospital stay, fluoroscopy,
and the operation times between the groups. Categorical
variables were presented as frequency (%), while continuous
variables were expressed in mean  standard deviation (SD).
A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Of 48 patients, the mean age was 7.3  4.4 (range 1e15)
years. The mean stone size was 12.95  3.15 (range 6e18)
mm. The micro-PERC group comprised 18 (72%) patients

Micro-PERC and retrograde intrarenal surgery in children
with a history of ESWL, and the RIRS group comprised 17
(73%) patients. The mean ages of the micro-PERC and RIRS
groups were 4  2.3 and 10.9  3 years, respectively
(p Z 0.001). However, the mean stone sizes were
12.2  2.8 and 13.7  3.5 mm, respectively (p > 0.05).
In terms of the degree of preoperative hydronephrosis
between the groups, the rates of mild and moderateesevere disease were 76% (19 out of 25) and 24% (6 out
of 25), and 69.5% (16 out of 23) and 30.4% (7 out of 23) in
the micro-PERC and RIRS groups, respectively. In the microPERC group the following stones were located: three in the
upper calyx, five in the middle calyx, one in the renal
pelvis, and 16 in the lower calyx. In the RIRS group, the
following stones were located: two in the upper calyx, six in
the middle calyx, and 15 in the lower calyx.
Based on the opacity of the stones, 52% had opaque
stones, 36% had semi-opaque stones, and 12% had nonopaque stones in the micro-PERC group. These rates were
52.1%, 39.1, and 8.6% in the RIRS group. Demographic
characteristics of the both patient groups are shown in
Table 1. Furthermore, the mean duration of operation was
75.1  18.9 min in the micro-PERC group and
62.3  15.3 min in the RIRS group (p > 0.05). In addition,
the mean duration of fluoroscopy was 115  35.4 s in the
micro-PERC group and 39.9  15.3 s in the RIRS group.
These results show that the duration of fluoroscopy was
statistically significantly longer in the micro-PERC group
(p < 0.001). The stone-free rates in the micro-PERC and
RIRS groups following the procedure were reported to be
84% (21/25) and 82.6% (19/23), respectively (p > 0.05).
Operative and postoperative data are shown in Table 2.

According to the Clavien complication classification
system, postoperative fever developed in two (8%) patients
and renal colic in three (12%) patients in the micro-PERC
group. In the RIRS group, postoperative fever was reported
in four (17.3%) patients, renal colic in four (17.3%) patients
(Clavien I), and sepsis in one (4.3%) patient (Clavien II). The
patients in both groups received conservative treatment.
Based on the weight of the stones, a JJ stent was applied
perioperatively in one patient in the micro-PERC group and
in four patients in the RIRS group, and were extracted 2
weeks after the operation. Decreased hemoglobin levels
requiring blood transfusion were not reported in any of the
group patients. The mean duration of hospitalization was
2.1  0.6 and 2.2  0.4 in the micro-PERC group and RIRS
group, respectively (p > 0.05).

Discussion
Minimally invasive procedures play a major role in the
treatment of pediatric urinary system stone disease. This is
due to the high recurrence risk and because it is accompanied by a high incidence of conditions, such as anatomical
and metabolic abnormalities, and by infectious diseases [2].
The efficacy and safety of PCNL has already been proven in
adults [7]. When the procedure was first used, urologists
were reluctant to use adult instruments in the management
of pediatric patients with kidney stones. This was due to the
potential risks, such as bleeding, major complications
associated with sepsis, the fear of exposure to radiation,
and parenchymal injury from the fluoroscopy. Recently
published extensive retrospective studies demonstrated a
90% success rate for PCNL; however, complications such as
high postoperative fever (30%) and bleeding requiring blood
transfusion (24%) were reported [8e10].
The all-seeing needle technique or micro-PERC as it is
otherwise known, accompanied by the 4.8F micro-sheath, in
the absence of an additional tract dilatation, has recently
gained popularity in endourological practice because standard and mini-PCNL techniques yield undesired complications. The micro-PERC technique is considered to have
major advantages, such as single-access under direct vision
and the prevention of potential complications, such as
bleeding and organ injury. Nonetheless, certain disadvantages, such as the absence of an appropriate tract diameter
and equipment for the extraction of fragmented stones,
have been already reported [11]. In patients with fewer
stones and in cases where other minimally invasive techniques (ESWL and RIRS) are unlikely to succeed, the microPERC technique offers an important option for experienced urologists [11,12]. In our study, the stone weight was
small in all patients who underwent the micro-PERC technique with a mean stone diameter of 12.2  2.8 mm.
Furthermore, in the present study, there was no statistically significant difference in either group in terms of the
duration of hospitalization. However, the duration of fluoroscopy and consequently exposure to radiation was found
to be 115  35.4 s in the micro-PERC group and
39.9  15.3 s in the RIRS group (p Z 0.001).
Unlike standard PCNL, low hemoglobin counts and the
need for blood transfusions were not reported with microPERC in previous studies [10,11]. Consistent with these data,

there were no reports of blood transfusions in our patients in
the micro-PERC group. In addition, previous reports
demonstrated a micro-PERC stone eradication rate ranging
from 80% to 90% in pediatric patients [13,14]. The results of
our study using micro-PERC showed a stone-free ratio of 84%,
which is consistent with the previous study findings.
The treatment of kidney stones with retrograde intrarenal surgery was first described in 1983 [15]. However, the
treatment of kidney stones using the retrograde intrarenal
surgical techniques only became widely used many years
later with the use of fiber optic technology-assisted flexible
ureteroscopy and the development of nitinol attachment
equipment in combination with the Ho:YAG laser assisted
the intracorporeal lithotripsy. Smaldone et al. [16] reported
a 91% stone-free ratio in 100 pediatric patients with a mean
stone diameter of 8.3 mm with about 52% of the stones
located in the kidney. About 9% of these children underwent more than one procedure. These findings indicated a
4.2% complication rate associated with one case of perforation requiring open neocystostomy because of the stricture. Our study reported a stone-free rate of 82.6% in the
RIRS group with postoperative complications according to
the Clavien classification, whereas minor grade IeII was
detected. None of our patients demonstrated ureteral
complications and, therefore, all were considered for soft
dilatation with JJ stenting at least 14 days before the
procedure [16].
There are a few recent studies that compare mini-PERC/
micro-PERC and RIRS. One of these, Resorlu et al. [17],
reported that mini-PERC and RIRS are highly effective
methods of treatment for children with stones up to 2 cm.
In another recent study related to comparing micro-PERC
and RIRS, Bas‚ et al. [18] reported that micro-PERC and
RIRS were highly effective methods for treatment of
moderately sized renal stones in children. Current study
had similar results with these trials.
Currently, the PCNL is the first-line treatment for stones
>2 cm in patients with pediatric stone disease. On the
other hand, ESWL is primarily recommended for stones
<2 cm in size. The RIRS is recommended as a second-line
treatment for smaller stones (10 mm). Otherwise, repeated
endoscopic procedures could increase the risk of residual
stones. Also, the PCNL is often considered for lower pole
stones of >10 mm, and micro-PERC and ESWL are considered as a second treatment of choice [19]. In the present
study, no patient in the RIRS or micro-PERC group had a
stone diameter of more than 2 cm. Eighteen (72%) patients
in the micro-PERC group and 17 (73%) patients in the RIRS
group underwent ESWL; however stone-free couldn’t be
provided.
Our study has certain limitations. The study was retrospective nature. In addition, we could not performed stone
analysis, because we used a Ho:YAG laser for disintegration
during lithotripsy. Additional randomized controlled studies
with a larger series are needed.

Conclusion
In conclusion, in recent years technological developments
in minimally invasive procedures, such as micro-PERC and
RIRS, have facilitated choices made by urologists in the

H. Sen et al.
effective and safe first-line treatment in pediatric patients.
Factors such as age of the patient, the diameter of the
stone, and anatomy of the urinary system should be
considered when choosing the optimal treatment procedure. Our study is one of the first to compare the two
methods for the treatment of pediatric kidney stone disease; however, more prospective, large-scale, randomized
clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings.
