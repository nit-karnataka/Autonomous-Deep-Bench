Abstract
Objective: To determine if reversing a deep or moderate block with sugammadex, compared with a shallow
block reversed with neostigmine, reduces the time to operating room discharge after surgery and the time
spent in the postanesthesia care unit.
Design: A randomized controlled trial.
Setting: Monocentric study performed from February 2011 until May 2012.
Patients: One hundred consenting women with American Society of Anesthesiologists grade I or II were
randomized into 2 groups.
Intervention: Laparoscopic hysterectomy was performed under desﬂurane general anesthesia. For the neostigmine (N) group, 0.45 mg · kg−1 rocuronium was followed by spontaneous recovery. A 5-mg rescue bolus was administered only if surgical evaluation was unacceptable. At the end of surgery, 50 μg · kg−1
neostigmine with glycopyrrolate was administered. For the sugammadex (S) group, a higher intubating
rocuronium dose (0.6 mg · kg−1) was followed by 5-mg boluses each time the train-of-four count exceeded
2. Sugammadex (2-4 mg · kg−1) was administered to reverse the block. All patients were extubated after
obtaining a train-of-four ratio of 0.9.
Measurements: The duration between the end of surgery and operating room discharge and the time spent in
the postanesthesia care unit.
Main results: The time till operating room discharge was shorter and more predictable in group S
(9.15 ± 4.28 minutes vs 13.87 ± 11.43 minutes in group N; P = .005). The maximal duration in group S

was 22 minutes, compared with 72 minutes in group N. The time spent in the postanesthesia care unit was
not signiﬁcantly different (group S: 47.75 ± 31.77 minutes and group N: 53.43 ± 40.57 minutes; P = .543).
Conclusion: Maintaining a deep neuromuscular block during laparoscopic hysterectomy reversed at the end
of the procedure with sugammadex enabled a faster and more predictable time till operating room discharge
than did the classical combination of a shallower block reversed with neostigmine.

1. Introduction
Increasing recent evidence suggests that inducing a deep
neuromuscular block (NMB) contributes to improving surgical laparoscopic conditions [1-3]. At the end of such procedures, sugammadex allows for fast and predictable reversal of
deep degrees of NMB induced by rocuronium [4,5]. Where
available, this new practice is challenging the classical management of intraoperative NMB and the limited reversal of moderate levels of blockade with neostigmine [6,7]. However, the
cost-effectiveness of the combination of deep NMB and sugammadex in daily clinical practice has not been determined [8].
To test the hypothesis that intraoperative deep NMB combined with sugammadex reversal reduces the time spent in
the operating room (OR) and improves patient recovery in
the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), we performed a randomized controlled study to compare this combination with shallow NMB reversed with neostigmine and glycopyrrolate in
patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopic surgery.
The primary outcome measures were the duration of surgery, pharmacologic reversal, OR discharge, OR and PACU
occupation times, and the length of hospital stay. The secondary outcome measure was a modiﬁed Aldrete recovery score
that was collected in the PACU. In addition, we discuss the potentially related economic opportunities.

2. Methods
2.1. Patient selection
After approval from the institutional ethical committee
(CHU Dinant Godinne om 050, Chairperson Pr P. Evrard, registered in November 2010 at the Belgian Federal Agency for
Medicines and Health products No. B03920109764) and the
acquisition of written informed consent, 100 patients were enrolled in the study between February 2011 and May 2012. The
results of the ﬁrst part of the study (ie, evaluations of the intraoperative surgical conditions between the groups) have previously been published [2]. This second part of the study reports
completely different data focused on timing and quality of
patients' recovery.
The study population included American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II female patients, ranging in age from 18 to
80 years, who were scheduled to undergo a laparoscopic

hysterectomy. We excluded patients with renal or hepatic diseases and those with neurologic disorders or allergies to any of
the medications used in the study protocol.

2.2. Study groups and randomization
The randomization of the 2 treatment groups was performed with the minimization procedure described by Taves
[9] and generalized by Pocock and Simon [10]. We enrolled
consecutively the patients and accounted for the following 4
criteria while allocating them to the treatment groups: (1) age
(18-40, 41-60, and 61-80 years), (2) body mass index (b20,
20-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39 kg/m2 ), (3) type of surgery
(laparoscopic hysterectomy, laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy, or laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy and cervical sacroﬁxation), and (4) number of pregnancies (0-5). The
randomization was performed with customized software.
2.2.1. Neostigmine group
A low intubating rocuronium dose (0.45 mg · kg−1) induced a short NMB (train-of-four [TOF] count 0 at the time
of tracheal intubation) followed by spontaneous recovery unless the surgical condition was unacceptable, as evaluated by
the senior experienced surgeon; in such cases, a rescue 5-mg
rocuronium bolus dose was administered. If necessary when
TOF ratio was b0.9, 50 μg · kg−1 neostigmine with glycopyrrolate was administered at the end of surgery to reverse any
residual NMB [7]. This study group was designed to correspond to usual clinical practice in numerous hospitals, avoiding deep and most moderate levels of blockade at the end of
the procedure to allow for as effective neostigmine reversal
as possible [6].

2.3. Sugammadex group
A higher intubating rocuronium dose (0.6 mg · kg−1) induced deeper and longer NMB. In the case of extended procedures, a deep NMB (TOF count b1) was reinduced by
repeated 5-mg bolus doses each time the TOF count reached
or exceeded 2. Sugammadex at 2 to 4 mg · kg−1 was administered after the end of surgery to reverse the moderate or deep
NMB accordingly [11].
One senior surgeon in charge of the study and all the clinical care nurses were blinded to the group assignment throughout the study. The senior anesthesiologist in charge of the
patient strictly observed the following protocol.

discharge. PACU = postanesthesia care unit; PONV = postoperative nausea or vomiting’ VAS = visual analog score.

2.4. Intraoperative care
The patient's premedication involved the administration of
0.5 mg of lorazepam 60 minutes before arrival in the operating
theater. The anesthesia equipment consisted of a 3-lead electrocardiogram, a noninvasive blood pressure measurement device,
and ﬁnger pulse oximetry. An intravenous line containing Ringer's lactate solution was inserted into a major left forearm vein.
We used a quantitative neuromuscular transmission (NMT)
monitor to guide rocuronium administration continuously in
every patient, from NMB induction to tracheal extubation.
Using electromyography, the adductor pollicis responses were
recorded after ulnar nerve stimulation (NeuroMuscular Transmission module; GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to good clinical research guidelines [12]. TOF
stimulations were applied every 20 seconds. When the TOF
count was 0, a posttetanic count was determined every 5
minutes.
Anesthesia was induced with intravenous sufentanil at
0.15 μg · kg−1, ketamine at 0.5 mg · kg−1, and propofol at
2 to 3 mg · kg−1 and immediately maintained with a minimum
of 6% desﬂurane to a target minimal alveolar concentration of
1 to 1.2 according to need (Zeus Inﬁnity–empowered anesthesia machine; Drägerwerk AG and Co, Lübeck, Germany).
After the patient lost consciousness, the ventilation was manually controlled. The randomized dose of rocuronium was then
administered, and tracheal intubation was performed once the
evoked muscular responses ceased (TOF count 0). Controlled
mechanical ventilation was initiated (semiclosed circuit, 40%45% oxygen in air) and adjusted to produce an end-tidal
carbon dioxide concentration within the range of 30 to
35 mm Hg. After the patient had been placed in the lithotomic
position, we determined the hemodynamic baseline before the
surgical procedure began. During the study period, the oropharyngeal and right-hand temperatures were maintained above
36°C and 32°C, respectively. The intraperitoneal CO2 insufﬂation pressure was set and monitored at 13 mm Hg throughout the procedure. The patient was placed in the maximal
Trendelenburg position at 45° for the duration of the surgery

(Maquet, Ardon, France). Postoperative pain and nausea
were prevented via the administration of 1 g of paracetamol,
1 mg · kg−1 of tramadol, 50 mg of alizapride, and 0.625 mg
of dehydrobenzperidol 30 minutes before the end of surgery.
We added 10 mg of butylhyoscine to prevent spasms on the
urinary catheter. At the end of the surgery, the abdominal cavity was completely exsufﬂated, and the abdominal ports were
removed. No further rocuronium bolus was administered. The
patient was placed ﬂat, the laparoscopic incisions were sutured, and the skin was dressed. The NMB reversal agent
was administered depending on the group and the level of
NMB recovery. The effects of pharmacologic reversal were
monitored until a TOF ratio greater than 0.9 was obtained; then
the administration of desﬂurane was interrupted, and the vapor
was washed out rapidly (Zeus 1-minute wash-out during mechanical ventilation followed by fresh gas ﬂow N10 L/min
O2 95% in air in spontaneous breathing mode) [13]. All patients were extubated after the recovery of spontaneous breathing, swallowing, and airway protection reﬂexes. The monitors
were removed, and the patients were transferred to the PACU
with oxygen.
We recorded the duration of the surgery (T1), the duration
of NMB reversal—from the injection of the reversal agent until a TOF ratio of 0.9 was achieved—(T2), the time between
the end of surgery and OR discharge (T3), and the total time
spent in the OR (T4).

2.5. Postanesthesia care unit
In the PACU, nurses who were blinded to the study group
evaluated the patients' recoveries on arrival and every 15 minutes, using a modiﬁed Aldrete score that included 7 items,
each of which counted for 2 points, as described in Table 1
[14-16]. When needed (ie, when the visual analog score was
N3), intravenous morphine (1 mg) was administered every 5 minutes to alleviate pain. Ondansetron (4 mg) was added in cases
of mild postoperative nausea or vomiting. After a minimum of
30 minutes, the patients were declared ready for discharge if
their recovery score was N12 and every item was under control.

For each patient, we recorded the initial recovery score, the
best recovery score, the discharge readiness time, and the morphine consumption. The reasons for all nonoptimal scores
(b14) were determined.

2.6. Sample size and statistics
The sample size established for the ﬁrst part of the study
with an α error rate of 0.05 and a power of 0.90 was calculated
to be 86 patients with the G*Power 3 software [2,17]. We randomized 100 patients into 2 groups. This patient number is
higher than recently published trials that were speciﬁcally designed with similar aims [3,18].
The data were compared between the 2 groups using the
Wilcoxon rank sum test. P values b.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
The economic considerations were based on a multifactorial evaluation of the OR costs. In our university training institution (400 beds, most of the staff are composed of salaried
employees), accounting for physician, trainee, nurse, and technical staff compensation, as well as building and medical
equipment amortization, we concluded that the cost of one
opened OR was approximately $20 per minute. This value is
within the range of published data [19].
According to the study location in Belgium, a 200-mg vial
of sugammadex costs $85, whereas a 2.5-mg vial of neostigmine with 0.5 mg of glycopyrrolate costs $4. Accounting for
OR and drug costs, a reduction of 4.25 minutes (85/20) in
OR occupation time per sugammadex vial was taken as the
signiﬁcant threshold for sugammadex cost-effectiveness that
would warrant further discussion.

3. Results
Of the 100 initially enrolled patients, 2 were excluded after
randomization due to intraoperative violations of the protocol
(ie, an inappropriate magnesium administration at induction

in one case and a failure apply the protocol in the other case)
and were prospectively replaced by 2 other patients who were
also randomized. The ﬁnal analysis included 100 patients (50
in neostigmine group and 50 in sugammadex group). The details of the patients' characteristics, which were similar due to
the randomization criteria, are provided in Table 2.
The patients included in the neostigmine and sugammadex
groups received a total rocuronium dose of 33.4 ± 6.9 mg and
57.0 ± 15.4 mg, including 19 and 131 additional 5 mg boluses, respectively. The NMB reversal agents were administered
according to the actual level of NMB recovery at the end of
skin dressing, as detailed in Fig. 1.
The results are presented in Table 3. Neither the potential
beneﬁt of reducing the duration of surgery with deep NMB
nor the overall time spent in the OR and PACU reached statistical signiﬁcance.
In contrast, Wilcoxon rank sum tests revealed highly significant differences in the NMB reversal times (T2) and OR discharge times (T3; Fig. 2). The latter difference between groups
was 4.72 minutes on average. Moreover, the range of values at
T3 (the maximal duration in the neostigmine group was 72 minutes and that in the sugammadex group was 22 minutes) was
clinically relevant because the interindividual variability in the
reversal time with neostigmine resulted in unpredictably delayed discharges from the OR.
In the PACU, the recovery scores, incidences of adverse effects, and morphine consumptions did not differ signiﬁcantly
between the groups. The hospital discharge times were also
not different.

4. Discussion
This study demonstrated that shorter and more predictable
OR discharges occur after the administration of sugammadex
to patients at moderate or deep levels of NMB than after the
administration of neostigmine to patients at moderate or even
much shallower levels of blockade. Similar to the results of
Geldner et al. [4], we conﬁrmed a clinically signiﬁcant beneﬁt
in the time spent by the patient in the OR after the end of surgery. The use of sugammadex allowed the anesthesiologist to
reverse moderate or deep NMB that was maintained until the
end of surgery while reducing the times required for safe extubation and OR discharge.
Sugammadex has been found to induce much faster reversals even from the deepest levels of blockade compared with
neostigmine in randomized controlled trials and in clinical
practice [4,5,20]. However, sugammadex reversal is not always as rapid as expected in every patient. The maximal reversal time provided by the literature when reversing deep NMB
with sugammadex is up to 20 minutes [20,21]. Moreover, inappropriate (ie, lower than recommended) sugammadex dosing can lead to uncertain effects [20,21]. Thus, sugammadex
clearly cannot replace good clinical practice and the systematic
use of NMT monitoring to manage each stage of NMB in every patient [6,22,23].

Patient discharge after deep NMB and sugammadex

Fig. 1 NMT monitoring. The actual level of neuromuscular blockade
measured by electromyography at the time of intubation (TOF count 0 in
all cases) and sugammadex or neostigmine administration (except if
TOF ratio N 0.9). The patients from sugammadex group are represented as white dots, and those from neostigmine group are represented as
black dots. See the Methods section for details. NMT = neuromuscular transmission; TOF = train-of-four; PTC = post tetanic count.

To limit the cost in the sugammadex group, the block recovered a moderate level before being deepened by rocuronium boluses, except after the abdominal ports have been
removed (few patients reached a TOF count of 3 or 4). On
the other hand, to minimize the duration of reversal, our study
design let the NMB recover shallow levels of blockade in most
patients in the neostigmine group (TOF count 4 with fade;
Table 3

111
Fig. 1). Despite this, the proper reversal of moderate to deep
NMB with sugammadex (2-4 mg · kg−1) was not only faster
than reversal with neostigmine (at moderate or much higher
NMB levels) but also more predictable, as demonstrated by a
much lower standard deviation (1.15 vs 15.43 minutes). This
beneﬁt was reﬂected in more rapid OR discharges. The time
spent in the OR between the end of surgery and discharge
was shorter on average, as has been previously published [4],
and also more predictable when sugammadex was used
(Fig. 2). The interindividual variability was more important
in the neostigmine group, which included several challenging
outliers. Such delayed and unpredictable discharges are a
threat to the efﬁcient organizations of the OR programs—this
issue is discussed later.
A deep NMB is deﬁned as a posttetanic count of 1 or more,
but a TOF count of 0; on the other hand, a moderate NMB gets
a TOF count of 1 to 3 [6,12]. Compared with moderate NMB,
there is good evidence that the maintenance of deep NMB optimizes the surgical conditions during abdominal and gynecologic surgeries, especially during lower abdominal
laparoscopies [1]. Speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst part of our study, only the deep NMB was found to prevent sudden abdominal wall
contractions that can induce unacceptable surgical conditions
(occurring in 28% of cases in the shallow block group) and
disrupt the course of the procedure [2]. Blobner et al [3] recently demonstrated that deep neuromuscular blockade improves
surgical laparoscopic conditions during cholecystectomy but
does not reduce surgical time. Our study conﬁrmed this ﬁnding and was unable to demonstrate a signiﬁcant reduction in
the duration of surgery under optimal conditions with deep
NMB. Neither of these studies was designed to evaluate the intraoperative patient safety.
As sugammadex was introduced into clinical practice,
some anesthesiologists noticed surprisingly fast arousals from

anesthesia. Among these anesthesiologists, Chazot and colleagues [24] described sudden electroencephalographic modiﬁcations and clinical signs of recovery that occurred 30
seconds after the administration of a sugammadex bolus.
These authors proposed a “spindle theory” to explain the acute
recovery. Even earlier, Vasella and colleagues [25] explained
similar results observed after the administration of neostigmine with the “afferentation theory,” which was based on the
observation that the arousal effect appeared to correspond with
a sudden increase in afferent signals from muscle stretch receptors. In contrast, when Illman and colleagues [26] conducted a study that was speciﬁcally designed to examine the
possible effects of sugammadex on the level of anesthesia as deﬁned by BIS and spectral entropy levels, they found no effect.
Based on evaluations of recovery using a modiﬁed Aldrete
score upon arrival in the PACU, our study demonstrated no
signiﬁcant beneﬁt of sugammadex reversal in terms of quality
or speed of recovery after general anesthesia. The patients
from both groups who were admitted to the PACU a few minutes after OR discharge presented similar recovery scores.
We speculate that we would have observed a different result
if the recovery assessments have been performed closer to

L. Putz et al.
tracheal extubation, but this would raise the question of the
clinical relevance of such a potential transient effect.
Similarly, our study revealed similar PACU stay durations in
both groups. Previous studies have demonstrated that residual
NMB on arrival to the PACU is associated with delayed discharge [27]. Our protocol imposed the criteria of the recovery
of a TOF ratio N0.9 on both groups before awakening and
extubating the patients, which ruled out the residual block
and its potential inﬂuence on PACU initial recovery assessments
and stay durations. In these conditions, reversal with sugammadex
did not further favor better recovery scores compared with neostigmine. The lack of differences between groups in the PACU
could be related to improved management of residual NMB in
the OR for every patient, based on quantitative NMT monitoring.
The postoperative factors that most frequently contributed
to the time spent in the PACU were the need for supplemental
pain management (visual analog score N3 in 54% of the patients), hypoxemia, hypotension, insufﬁcient consciousness
recovery, and postoperative nausea or vomiting (see Table 3).
However, there was no signiﬁcant difference between groups.
This ﬁnding conﬁrms recent studies that have been conducted
in the same context and compared recovery from deep
NMB + sugammadex vs moderate NMB + neostigmine after
laparoscopic surgery [4,18,28].
The translation of the possible beneﬁts of NMB reversed by
sugammadex in reducing the hospital stay is controversial.
Some studies have demonstrated signiﬁcant decreases in postoperative pneumonia [29] and hospital discharge time (2.0 vs
2.2 days) [30]. However, as with other studies [31,32], we
found no difference between our 2 groups. Further studies
should speciﬁcally determine whether the intraoperative advantage of deep NMB (ie, improvements in surgical conditions) and reversal with sugammadex (ie, reducing OR
discharge time and residual NMB) improve patient outcomes.
Compared with the neostigmine group, the use of sugammadex was associated with a more predictable OR discharge and
trend toward shorter stays on average (ie, total OR + PACU
time, P = .064; see Table 3 for details). Better predictability
and shorter times allow for a better dynamism of the operating
theater staff by improving turnover while respecting the OR
schedule as closely as possible. However, the economic value
of the time saved by improved OR efﬁciency remains unclear
and depends on the ability of the staff to perform other productive activities and the ability of the OR manager to proactively
ﬁne-tune the stafﬁng to match the surgical demand [8,33-35].
As with the OR, the PACU is a bottleneck in patient ﬂow.
Any delay of admission or discharge, particularly in the late afternoon or evening, might affect the costs of the PACU due to
the salaries of the nurses and anesthesiologists (eg, extra hours
have higher costs) and should be limited as much as possible
[27]. Because it prevents residual NMB, the association between NMT monitoring and sugammadex could reduce the
times spent in the OR and PACU and thus the associated costs.
However, sugammadex would be cost-effective only if the reduction in recovery time occurs mainly in the operating theater
(high-value staff time) rather than in the PACU (relatively

lower-value staff time) [8]. For instance, in the conditions of
our study, the total excess time spent in OR waiting for neostigmine reversal (220 minutes) could compensate for the cost
of one sugammadex vial for every patient, which was sufﬁcient in most cases. The ﬁnancial consequences of deep
NMB management based on sugammadex reversal depend
on multiple factors that include the intraoperative advantages
in terms of the surgical conditions, the value of the time
spared, and who is charged for the drugs (ie, the health care
system, the hospital, the department, or the patient). Further
studies should precisely deﬁne the ﬁnancial effects of such
strategies in the speciﬁc conditions of each health care system
and hospital cost and for speciﬁc surgical procedures.
In conclusion, the maintenance of a moderate to deep NMB
during laparoscopic hysterectomy with reversal at the end of
the procedure with sugammadex enabled faster and more predictable OR discharges than did the classical combination of
shallower NMB reversed with neostigmine.
