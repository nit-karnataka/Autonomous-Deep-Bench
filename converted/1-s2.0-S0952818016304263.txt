Abstract
Background: Postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) is a common complication in the
postanesthesia care unit (PACU), but also one of the most controversial issues. Many studies and trials demonstrated that some methods and techniques can reduce the incidence and the extent of the phenomenon.
Study Objective: To determine the incidence of RNMB in the PACU at standardized times after extubation
with the implementation of a protocol of careful neuromuscular blockade management.
Design: Randomized, single-blinded controlled clinical trial.
Setting: Operating room and PACU.
Patients: A total of 120 patients of either sex with American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 1, 2, and 3, aged
18 to 80 years were scheduled to undergo elective abdominal surgical procedures lasting for at least 60 minutes.
Interventions: Patients were randomized to receive either cisatracurium (n = 60) or rocuronium (n = 60) at
the time of intubation and during surgery. Every patient received quantitative neuromuscular monitoring
during general anesthesia. On completion of surgery, patients were given neostigmine 0.05 mg kg−1. Patients were extubated at a train-of-four (TOF) ratio ≥0.9.
Measurements: TOF measurements were performed 15, 30, and 60 minutes after extubation. Tolerability of
neuromuscular monitoring was evaluated with a scale from 1 to 10 (with 1 meaning no discomfort at all and
10 meaning maximal discomfort or pain).

Residual neuromuscular dysfunction

199

Results: Six, 11, and 14 patients (5.0%, 9.2%, and 11.7%) exhibited a TOF ratio b0.9 at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after extubation, respectively. No statistically signiﬁcant difference in the postoperative RNMB between cisatracurium and rocuronium was found. The median tolerability score for neuromuscular
monitoring was 3.
Conclusion: Careful conduction, monitoring, and subsequent reversal of neuromuscular block may allow
for obtaining considerably low incidence of residual neuromuscular block. However, our trial shows that
some mid- and long-term cases of TOF ratios b0.9 can still occur, possibly jeopardizing the patients' postoperative recovery.

1. Introduction
Postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade (RNMB) is
a relatively common and unrecognized complication of early
postoperative recovery. Although the increasing use of intraoperative monitoring of neuromuscular transmission has been
proven to be useful in titrating the dose of neuromuscular
blocking agents and facilitating the recovery of patients' optimal muscle strength, the presence of signiﬁcant muscle weakness has been invariably documented in the postanesthesia
care unit (PACU) [1-4]. Various recent studies have, in fact,
demonstrated that many patients continue to arrive in the
PACU with a T4:T1 ratio (TR) on accelerographic monitoring
of b0.9, a value universally considered unsafe for a valid neuromuscular recovery [5,6].
Currently, a return of the TR at the adductor pollicis muscle
to a value of at least 0.90 or greater is considered a reasonable
index of satisfactory muscle recovery from nondepolarizing
neuromuscular block [7,8].
Some surveys showed that anesthesiologists underestimate
the incidence of RNMB and inconstantly use the approaches,
which proved to be effective at preventing it [9,10]. Moreover,
there are only a limited number of studies investigating the recurrence and evolution of RNMB later than the arrival of the
patient in the PACU [11].
This single-center, single-blind, randomized study aimed at
determining the incidence of RNMB at standardized times after tracheal extubation, after either cisatracurium or rocuronium intraoperative administration and regular neostigmine
reversal. A protocol of attentive management of intraoperative
neuromuscular blockade was adopted.
We also explored the individual's subjective pain and tolerability on repeated train-of-four (TOF) stimulations after complete awakening from anesthesia.

2. Materials and methods
This study was approved by the local ethics committee
(Ref.: 2633P/bis) and registered with EudraCT (Ref.: 2012-00239868). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.
One hundred twenty patients of either sex with American
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades 1, 2, and 3, aged

18 to 80 years, coming for elective abdominal surgical procedures lasting for at least 60 minutes, and requiring intraoperative neuromuscular, blockade were recruited for a singlecenter single-blind randomized trial. Data were collected at
the University Hospital of Padua, Italy.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with cardiorespiratory abnormalities (New York Heart Association heart
failure grades 3 and 4, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, and restrictive lung disease), renal insufﬁciency (serum creatinine N1.6 mg/dL), liver dysfunction (liver
enzymes—serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase/serum
glutamic pyruvic transaminase values elevated by more than
50% of normal), underlying neuromuscular disease, the use
of drugs known to interfere with neuromuscular transmission,
intraoperative hypothermia (core temperature b35°C), history
of heavy smoking, and severe obesity (body mass index
N35 kg/m2).
Patients were informed about the TOF measurements they
were listed to undergo postoperatively, and the possible discomfort or pain associated with it.
A computer-generated 1:1 randomization list was used to
allocate the muscle relaxant to be used intraoperatively (cisatracurium or rocuronium). This was revealed to the anesthesiologist upon entering the operating room (OR); the patient was
unaware of it.
Standard intraoperative monitoring included electrocardiography, capnography, noninvasive or invasive blood pressure, pulse oxymetry, and body temperature measurement.
Anesthesia was induced with 1.5 to 2.5 mg kg−1 propofol
and 2 μg kg−1 fentanyl. Before anesthesia induction, 2 standard electrocardiogram electrodes were applied over the ulnar
nerve at the wrist; the acceleration transducer was taped to the
distal phalanx of the thumb and the temperature probe was
applied to the palm. Right after propofol induction dose and
before administering the muscle relaxant, calibration of the
TOF-Watch SX (Organon Ltd, Dublin, Ireland) was obtained
in every patient. After that, patients received for muscle relaxation and intubation either cisatracurium (0.2 mg kg−1) or
rocuronium (0.6 mg kg−1).
The administration of the neuromuscular blocking drug
(NMBD) was repeated in the course of surgery, as necessary,
to maintain a TOF count ≤2. No additional muscle relaxant
was administered if surgery was expected to end within 30 minutes after the last administration.

General anesthesia was maintained with a continuous infusion of propofol (targeting a bispectral index in the range of
30-40) plus boluses of fentanyl, and/or remifentanil in continuous infusion. Physical methods and warm ﬂuids were constantly adopted to maintain body temperature.
On completion of surgery, all patients received neostigmine
0.05 mg kg−1 (and atropine 0.03 mg kg−1), only after they had
reached spontaneously a TOF count of 4. Tracheal extubation
was performed at a TOF ratio ≥0.9.
All TOF measurements were performed 15, 30, and 60 minutes after tracheal extubation. Postoperative TR values were
detected and recorded by an anesthesiologist unaware of the
intraoperatively administered NMBD. Similar to the procedure reported by Murphy and colleagues [12,13], to ensure precision, we averaged 2 measurements that were separated by 20
seconds; if the initial 2 measurements were not within 10%
agreement, 2 additional measurements were then performed
(again at 20-second interval), and averaged the 2 closest TOF
ratios. Careful attention was paid to not disconnect the TOF
sensors and electrodes while moving the patients from the
OR to the PACU.
Patients were made aware before and after surgery that
if they would have been unable to tolerate the TOF stimulations, they would have been let free to withdraw from the clinical trial.
At the same scheduled postoperative time points (15, 30,
and 60 minutes after extubation), soon after the TOF ratio
measurements, all patients were asked to perform the “headlift test” (ie, the ability to lift the head for 5 seconds).
After the third and last TOF determinations, the individual's subjective discomfort/pain caused by neuromuscular
stimulation was assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS)
from 1 to 10 (VAS score, with 1 meaning no discomfort at
all and 10 maximal discomfort or pain).
Patient demographic data including age, sex, weight,
height, body mass index, ASA physical status, and preexisting
medical conditions were recorded from the preoperative anesthesia evaluation form. Intraoperative variables such as type of
surgery, duration of general anesthesia, duration of surgery,
type and dose of administered analgesics, time from ﬁrst to last
NMBD administration, time from last dose of NMBD to neostigmine reversal, and time from reversal to extubation, were
recorded from the anesthesia record.

2.1. Statistical methods
Patients' characteristics are presented as count and percentage of patients in each category and compared between the 2
groups with χ2 or Fisher exact test in case of categorical variables. In case of quantitative variables, mean and standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum are displayed,
and the 2 groups were compared with Wilcoxon rank sum test
because the distribution of the variables was not normal.
Normality was evaluated with Shapiro-Wilk test.
Based on the results of the 2 recent randomized studies published by Murphy and coworkers [11,14], where the incidence

P. Feltracco et al.
of RNMB (TOF ratio ≤0.9) with intraoperative acceleromyographic monitoring and neostigmine reversal is reported to be
4.5% and 14.5%, respectively, a sample size of 60 patients per
group has been estimated to allow for a precision of ±8.5% for
the 95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI) considering an incidence equal to 10.5%.
The incidence and 95% CI for TR b 0.9 at 15, 30, and
60 minutes, and of positive head-lift test at 15, 30, and 60 minutes were estimated with the binomial method.
The time course of incidence of TR b 0.9 and of positive
head-lift test were compared between the 2 groups with a binary logistic regression model for repeated measures, and the results were expressed as odds ratio and 95% CI.
The statistical signiﬁcance was set at the 5% level. The
data were entered in an Excel spreadsheet. The randomization list and the statistical analysis were performed by a
statistician with SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) for
Windows.

3. Results
Of 231 patients screened, 120 were randomized, and all of
them completed the study (Fig. 1). Patients' characteristics are
presented in Table 1. There were no differences between
groups in demographic, clinical characteristics, preexisting
medical conditions (data not shown), or ASA physical status.
The 2 groups did not differ in duration of anesthesia, duration
of surgery, type of administered analgesia, time interval from
ﬁrst to last administration of NMBD, and time interval from
reversal to extubation. However, the 2 treatment groups did
show a statistically signiﬁcant difference in the time interval
from the last administration of NMBD to the administration
of reversal (ie, the time needed to achieve spontaneous recovery of 4 twitches). In fact, the mean (SD) time interval
in the cisatracurium group was 55.3 (25.8) minutes, compared with 70.3 (26.4) minutes in the rocuronium group
(P = .0008).
In Table 2, the number of patients with TOF ratio b0.9 at
the considered time points, and the repeated-measures logistic
regression results are reported. In particular, in the cisatracurium group, at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after extubation, 2, 7,
and 5 patients respectively displayed a TR b 0,9; 5 out of 7 patients with TR b 0,9 at 30 minutes, and 3 out of 5 patients with
TR b 0,9 at 60 minutes were “de novo” patients. In the rocuronium group, all the 4 patients with TR b 0.9 at 15 minutes
displayed also similar values at 30 minutes, whereas at the
60-minute time measurement, all 9 patients but 2 with a TR
b 0.9 were de novo patients.
No statistically signiﬁcant difference between the 2 groups
was found in TOF ratio b0.9 incidence, at the scheduled time
course (P = .5772).
Table 3 shows the incidence of positive head-lift test and
the repeated-measures logistic regression results. No statistically signiﬁcant difference between the 2 groups was found

in the head-lift test incidence (P = .1462) at the considered
time course.
When we considered the discomfort/pain suffered at postoperative NMT stimulations, the mean (SD) VAS score was
2.9 (1.6) and the median was 3 (ﬁrst quartile = 2, third quartile = 4; Fig. 2).
TOF discomfort/pain was not different between the 2 treatment groups (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = .3842).

4. Discussion
In this trial, the incidence of RNMB 15 minutes after extubation was considerably low: 5.0% overall, and precisely 3.3%
with cisatracurium and 6.7% with rocuronium. Cisatracuriumand rocuronium-associated incidences of RNMB at 15
minutes should be considered similar because the 95% CIs
were overlapping in the 2 groups.
The low rates of RNMB we observed are comparable with
those of Baillard and colleagues [15], who described a 3.5%

Table 1

incidence in one cohort of patients (mostly treated with atracurium) and 9% in another cohort treated with rocuronium or
vecuronium. Our data are also similar to those reported in
the previously cited studies by Murphy and coworkers
[11,14]: 4.5% RNMB incidence in their 2008 report and
14.5% in the cohort of 2011study.
The rate of RNMB observed in our patients at 15 minutes
after extubation greatly differs from that described in the
studies by Xie and colleagues [17] (30.6%) and in the
meta-analysis by Naguib et al [16] (TR b 0.9 upon arrival
in the PACU detected in N40% of patients). However, in
the Xie study, despite acceleromyographic neuromuscular
intraoperative monitoring, the combination of 2 different nondepolarizing NMBDs during surgery, lack of treatment of hypothermia, and NMBD dose adjusting according to the
“arbitrary” order of the attending anesthesiologists, could have
contributed to a N30% rate of TR b 0.9. The 40% incidence of
residual muscle dysfunction reported by Naguib et al [16]
could instead be ascribed to the old studies included, often
very different in design and with different surgical procedures,
where long- and intermediate-acting NMBDs were used,

intraoperative TOF monitoring rarely applied, and with a signiﬁcant heterogeneity both in the time and the dose of anticholinesterase antagonism.
It is to underline that 15 minutes after extubation, no patient
showed a TR b 0.7 and just one (0.8%) had a TR between 0.7
and 0.8; in the patient population who displayed a TOF ratio
b 0.9, the mean (SD) TR was still high, 0.85 (0.04), hence
close to a value considered “quite safe.”
Our anesthetic approach approximately resembles the protocol by Murphy and coworkers with a 14.5% incidence of
TR b 0.9 at PACU arrival in the acceleromyography group
[11]. Minimal differences between the 2 studies are the reversal, which started also at 3 TOF counts in the study by Murphy
et al (instead of 4 in our series), and the timing of tracheal
extubation, performed in 10 patients of their series before a
TR of 0.8.
The results we observed at the other 2 scheduled time measurements showed a 9.2% overall incidence of TR b 0.9 at 30
minutes after extubation (11.7% with cisatracurium and 6.7%
with rocuronium), and 11.7% at 60 minutes (8.3% with cisatracurium and 15.0% with rocuronium).
These data, which do not a mark difference between the 2
NMBDs (95% CIs still overlapping), are consistent with an increase in the incidence of residual muscle dysfunction when
compared with the observations at 15 minutes, and are more
closely related to the RNMB rates described at various times
after PACU arrival in previous series [18]. No signiﬁcant differences in the recovery patterns of cisatracurium vs rocuronium at 20 minutes postreversal were also reported by
Kopman and colleagues [19].
To reafﬁrm the recognized discordance between the classical clinical signs of recovery of muscular strength and TR
values, also in our population, of those patients with TR
b 0.9 at 30 minutes, “only” 28.6% of cisatracurium and
50.0% of rocuronium group were not able to keep the head

up for 5 seconds). At 60 minutes, in the rocuronium group, 5
of 9 patients (55.6%) with TR b 0.9 could not raise the head
for 5 seconds, whereas none of those in the cisatracurium
group with a TR b 0.9 at 60 minutes had a positive head-lift
test result.
Unfortunately, our results cannot be comparable with data
of similar clinical trials because no studies investigating the
RNMB phenomenon with TOF quantitative monitoring at
ﬁxed postoperative times have been published yet.
Nevertheless, the presence of rates up to 15% of TR b 0.9
till 1 hour after the end of the procedures should be considered
a relevant occurrence. It is recognized that the intermediateacting NMDBs can show some clinical effect up to 2 hours after the last administration [6], long after the cessation of the effects of neostigmine. It is very likely that at least some of the
mid- and long-term cases of TR b 0.9 we detected, were due
to a resume of the effect of the NMBD, which revealed when
the neostigmine effect was over (neostigmine is known to last
30-120 minutes). We can reasonably exclude that these cases
were due to drug interference with muscle paralysis, because
no patient received any known recurarization-triggering substances or treatments (such as benzodiazepines, magnesium
sulfate, calcium-channel blockers, aminoglicoside antibiotics,
or auto-transfusion procedures).
We presume that the low incidences of RNMB we detected
at different times postoperatively can be attributed to the speciﬁc design of our trial, which was based on accurate intraoperative TOF monitoring, TOF-guided NMBD administration,
regular antagonist administration at recovery from anesthesia,
and correct clinical test evaluation before extubation.
It should be noted, however, that neither a careful conduction of an intraoperative neuromuscular blockade nor the routine administration of reversal drugs at appropriate time and
dose can guarantee the avoidance of neuromuscular dysfunction in the early postoperative period. As mentioned above

also in our series, the numerical TOF ratio showed a slight incremental rate of TR b 0.9 at 30 minutes, and moreover at 60
minutes after extubation.
The time interval from the last administration of NMBD to
the administration of reversal (ie, the time needed to obtain
spontaneous recovery of 4 twitches) was signiﬁcantly higher
in the rocuronium group (mean, 70.3 minutes) compared with
cisatracurium (mean, 55.3 minutes); this is in accordance with
some observations that report an intrinsic clinical variability of
rocuronium and a rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block,
to some extent deeper and longer lasting than cisatracuriuminduced block [20,21].
At the end, in no cases we omitted the reversal, even when a
long time interval lasted from the last NMBD administration.
Neostigmine was given only upon reaching the 4 twitches at
adductor pollicis, and extubation was performed when both
the deﬁned quantitative TR and clinical criteria were achieved.
The feasibility of a repeated postoperative TOF monitoring
on an awake patient has not been evaluated in most of the clinical trials. The main cause refraining anesthesiologists from
performing TOF quantitative monitoring early after surgery
is the supposed discomfort/pain and reluctance of the patient
to peripheral nerve stimulation. In our series, the mean VAS
score (SD) evaluating the discomfort/pain at postoperative
NMT stimulations was 2.9 (1.6), and the median was 3 (ﬁrst
quartile = 2, third quartile = 3.5). No patient refused to undergo repeated peripheral nerve stimulation at successive postoperative times. TOF discomfort/pain was not different between
the 2 treatment groups.

Murphy and colleagues [22] performed a TOF-Watch monitoring in the OR and PACU using 50-mA stimulation currents; only 8% of patients recalled TOF stimulations.
Similarly to previous trials [14], to obtain more reliable results, we opted to maintain higher current intensities (range,
40-60 mA, as derived from the preoperative calibration).
Our results show that TOF monitoring on the postoperative
awake patient is well tolerated, with 87.5% of the patients
communicating a VAS score between 1 and 4. Prolonged effects of intraoperative opioids, along with other “transitional”
analgesics, likely contributed to such a high tolerance to repeated TOF stimulations. Thirty-one percent of patients were
administered analgesics soon after surgery; this could have
possibly increased their tolerance to awake TOF stimulations.
These data encourage and support the repeated use of neuromuscular monitoring at PACU arrival, as a mean to discover
a delayed recovery from RNMB.
This study has limitations. There was a lack of anesthesiologist's blindness to muscle relaxant; however, the computergenerated randomization made her and/or him aware of the
type of NMDB only during the intraoperative period; the physician in charge for detecting postoperative TR values was unaware of it. The TOF ratio of 0.9 we considered to exclude a
potential RNMB may be judged a surrogate marker of satisfactory neuromuscular function recovery, and we could have
missed low levels of residual paralysis and underestimated
the real incidence of RNMB.
According to some authors, with the widespread use of
acceleromyography, a TOF recovery to 1.0 has to be

considered a better target [23]. We have nevertheless opted for
0.9 after 2 TOF stimulations applied successively and recorded
at a 20-second interval, because, also in various recent studies,
this threshold is still reported to be harmless in preventing major adverse effects of RNMB [3,17,18].
We are aware that by measuring TR at intervals longer than
that last scheduled, we could have possibly detected higher
rates of RNMB; a great variability among individuals in the
duration of neostigmine-induced reversal, despite the correct
drug dosage, has, in fact, been described [24].
In conclusion, despite the improvement in their use, the administration of intermediate-acting NMBDs cisatracurium and
rocuronium is still associated with a variable incidence of postoperative incomplete neuromuscular recovery.
Vigilant intraoperative quantitative neuromuscular monitoring, NMBD administration at the occurrence of TOF
count = 2, constant reversal long before extubation, and cautious extubation with a TR ≥ 0.9 may contribute to a considerably low incidence of residual neuromuscular block.
