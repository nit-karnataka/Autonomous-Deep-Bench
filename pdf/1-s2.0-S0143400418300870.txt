ABSTRACT

Introduction: In mink, as many as 65% of embryos die during gestation. The causes and the mechanisms of embryonic mortality remain unclear. The purpose of our
study was to examine global gene expression changes during embryo invasion in mink, and thereby to identify potential signaling pathways involved in implantation
failure and early pregnancy loss.
Methods: Illumina's next-generation sequencing technology (RNA-Seq) was used to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in implantation (IMs) and interimplantation sites (inter-IMs) of uterine tissue.
Results: We identified a total of 606 DEGs, including 420 up- and 186 down-regulated genes in IMs compared to inter-IMs. Gene annotation analysis indicated
multiple biological pathways to be significantly enriched for DEGs, including immune response, ECM complex, cytokine activity, chemokine activity and protein
binding. The KEGG pathway including cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, Jak-STAT, TNF and the chemokine signaling pathway were the most enriched. A gene
network was constructed, and hub nodes such as CSF3, ICAM1, FOS, IL1B, IL8, CD14 and MYC were found through network analysis.
Discussion: This report provides a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms of embryo implantation in mink.

1. Introduction
Implantation in mustelid carnivores has several unique characteristics. Trophoblastic cells do not extrude through the zona pellucida of
expanded blastocysts just prior to attachment of the embryo [1]. Mink
also exhibit a high degree of trophoblast invasion of the uterine epithelium at the site of embryo attachment, but although the maternal
blood vessels are surrounded by trophoblast cells, the integrity of the
vessels is maintained [2], The resultant placenta is endotheliochorial
and decidual, and is described as a discontinuous zonary type [3].
Embryo growth and survival are dependent upon establishment of the
placenta, which in turn guarantees a nutrient supply, gas exchange and
waste removal. Defective trophoblastic invasion is associated with abnormalities of placental development and resulting fetal growth defects
have been reported in primary [4], mouse [5], bovine [6] and sheep
[7].
Prenatal mortality is a critical barrier to successful mink reproduction. Approximately 60% of embryos are lost during pregnancy, and
about 20% of these are lost during the pre-implantation period [8]. The
reasons and mechanisms for embryonic mortality in mink are not well
understood. The sparse research on mink reproduction mainly focuses

on embryo diapause and its regulation. The molecular pathways involved in this process include prolactin-induced ODC1 expression in the
uterus via pSTAT1 and mTOR, thereby regulating uterine polyamine
levels [9], important genes include COX2, LIF [10], VEGF [11] and Msx
[12].
Trophoblast cell differentiation, invasion and placental formation in
mink has received little attention. Desmarais [13] reported that nuclear
receptors of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family are implicated in implantation and early placental formation in
mink. Lopes [14] reported that prostaglandin E (PGE) regulates uterine
and placental vascular development through activation of VEGF transcriptional activity. So far, genuine candidate genes and molecular
mechanisms involved in embryo invasion in mink remain largely unknown. In recent years, high-throughput transcriptomic approaches
have been developed, making it possible to study genome-wide gene
expression and complex signaling networks. By using these approaches,
several studies have reported altered uterine gene expression profiles
associated with embryo implantation in humans [15], mice [16], sheep
[17], cows [18] and pigs [19].
In this study, we present the first application of RNA-Seq in mink by
sequencing RNA from the uterus in IMs and inter-IMs. The data from

invasion in the mink uterus. Our study contributes toward a deeper
understanding of the molecular events associated with implantation
failure and early pregnancy loss in mink.

(Thermo Scientific). Only RNA samples meeting the following requirements were used in this study, the ratios of A260/280 was between 1.8 and 2.2, A260/A230 ratio no less than 2, the ratio of 28S/18S
ribosomal RNA should be between 1.5 and 2.0, electrophoresis bands
on agarose gel were clear, and RIN (RNA integrity number)
value ≥ 7.0. One μg of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis in a 20 μl
transcript system, including 4 μl TransScript® All-in-One SuperMix, 1 μl
gDNA Remover, and variable RNase-Free Water. Real-time PCR was
determined using a CFX96 Real-time System (Bio-Rad) with 20 μl PCR
reaction mixture that included 10 μl 2 × SG Fast qPCR Master Mix (BBI
Life Sciences), 0.4 μl of 10 μM forward primer, 0.4 μl of 10 μM reverse
primer, 2 μl DNF buffer, 0.5 μl of cDNA and 6.7 μl PCR-grade water. The
reaction conditions were 95 °C for 3 min, then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3s,
60 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 20s. GAPDH was used as a reference gene
for normalization, which was previously used in studies on the mink
endometrium [11–14]. RT negative control reactions contained RNaseFree Water instead of total RNA. Non-template control reactions contained nuclease-free water instead of templates, and plates were discarded if more than one of the negative control triplicates was contaminated. Individual samples of a triplicate were discarded if they had
irregular melting curves or if the coefficient of variation was greater
than 0.02. The qRT-PCR was perfomed in three biological and three
technical replicates. Relative expression levels of the selected genes
were calculated using the CFX Manager software. Statistical analyses of
qRT-PCR data were performed using Student's paired t-test, and differences with p < 0.05 were considered to be significant. Primers for
each selected gene were designed using primer-BLAST software (www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/.) and are listed in Supplementary
materials 6 (Table S2).

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Animals and sample collection
All procedures involving animal care were approved by the experimental animal use and care committee of the Institute of Special
Animal and Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
(ISAPSWAPS2016000302). All females were mated with two fertile
males, at one week intervals, according to the usual commercial
farming procedures. A successful mating was confirmed by the presence
of motile spermatozoa in vaginal smears. In mink, termination of embryonic diapause is induced by increasing secretion of prolactin from
the pituitary gland [20–22], which stimulates luteal function thereby
increasing progesterone secretion associated with blastocyst reactivation and implantation. A previous study showed that diapause can be
artificially terminated by treatment with prolactin [21], Our study used
a standard protocol consisting of injecting 1 mg/kg/d of ovine prolactin
(Sigma) daily beginning 7–9 days following the last mating and continuing for 12 days. We collected uterine samples on day 13 after the
initiation of Prolactin injection, at the time when implantation occurs,
as previously described [21,22]. IMs were identified by injection of
0.1 ml of 1% Chicago blue (Sigma) in 0.85% sodium chloride. The IMs
and inter-IMs from mink uterus were collected and stored in liquid
nitrogen for RNA-Seq.
2.2. RNA-seq analysis

2.4. Gene ontology (GO) pathway and network analysis

Total RNA was extracted from uterus samples using TRIzol® reagent
(Invitrogen, n = 3 for each IMs and inter-IMs group). RNA integrity was
assessed by the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. The following RNA
quality control parameters were used: A260/A280 ratio ≥1.8, A260/
A230 ratio ≥2.0 and RIN (RNA integrity number) value ≥ 7.0.1.5 μg
RNA from each sample was used as input material for the RNA samples
preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using the NEBNext®
Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) and index codes
were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Clustering of the
index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation
System using the TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina). After
cluster generation, the libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq
platform and paired-end reads were acquired. Raw reads were firstly
preprocessed and filtered to clean reads through in-house perl scripts.
Transcriptome assembly was based on the left.fq and right.fq using
Trinity [23] with min_kmer_cov set to 2 by default and all other parameters set to default. Gene function was annotated from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Differential expression
analysis of two groups was performed by using the DESeq R package.
The P-values and false discovery rate were adjusted and controlled by
using the Benjamini and Hochberg approach. The DEGs were screened
based on DESeq analysis [24], taking |log2(fold change)| > 1 and
p < 0.05 as the cut-off.

GO enrichment analysis of DEGs was implemented using the GOseq
R packages based on Wallenius non-central hyper-geometric distribution [25], which can adjust for gene length bias in DEGs. The significance cutoff for adjusted p-values (Benjamini-Hochberg multiple
test correction method) was set at 0.05. KOBAS software was used to
test the statistical enrichment of DEGs in the KEGG pathway. The sequences of DEGs were blast (blastx) to the genome of a related species
(http://string-db.org/) to obtain the predicted PPI (protein protein interaction) of these DEGs. Then the PPI of these DEGs were visualized in
Cytoscape. In the PPI network, nodes stand for proteins, and edges
represent interactions between 2 proteins.
3. Results
3.1. Identification of transcriptomic differences
RNA-Seq libraries were prepared for IMs (n = 3) and inter-IMs
(n = 3) of mink uterus. Data analysis revealed that sequencing of the
libraries yielded more than 55.7 and 57.4 million reads for the IMs and
inter-IMs groups, respectively. After removing invalid reads, we acquired more than 53.6 and 55.0 million clean reads from each group. A
total of 160,816 unigenes were obtained from clean reads using the
optimized parameters.
We identified a total of 606 DEGs. Among them, 420 genes were upregulated and 186 genes were down-regulated at IMs in comparison to
inter-IMs. Of these, 582 annotated genes (376 genes fold > 2, and 97
genes fold > 1.5) were differentially expressed between IMs and interIMs, 402 annotated genes (223 genes fold > 2, and 84 genes fold >
1.5) were upregulated, and 180 annotated genes (153 genes fold > 2,
and 13 genes fold > 1.5) were down-regulated at IMs in comparison to
inter-IMs (Table 1). Annotated DEGs are shown in Supplementary
materials l (Table S1). The top 20 most DEGs (highest P value) are
presented in Table 2.

2.3. Quantitative real-time PCR validation of mRNA
RNA samples were isolated from an independent set of biological
replicates from those used in the RNAseq (n = 3 for each IMs and interIMs group). Total RNA was extracted from IMs and inter-IMs of uterine
samples with Trizol® Reagent (Invitrogen). RNA samples were treated
with DNaseⅠ (invitrogen) to eliminate potential genomic DNA contamination. RNA integrity was assessed by the Agilent Bioanalyzer
2100 system. The quality and quantity of the RNA were verified by
optical density reading using a NanoDrop 200c spectrophotometer

the inter-IMs (P < 0.05). Among these DEGs, we validated 18 genes
using qRT-PCR. The expression trend of these genes determined by qRTPCR showed a good agreement with RNA-seq results, suggesting a high
quality of our results. To further understand gene functions and their
regulatory mechanisms, GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis
were performed. The main network showed several genes associated
with immune response, cell adhesion and locomotion, cytokines and
chemokines activity, ECM complex and protein binding.

Enriched GO terms are classified according to biological process
(BP), molecular functions (MF) and cellular components (CC). In the BP
category, 400 terms were significantly enriched, including immune
response, chemotaxis, signal transduction, cell adhesion, cell migration,
and regulation of inflammatory response. The enriched CC categories
were: extracellular matrix, basement membrane, cell projection, and
plasma membrane receptor complex. With respect MF, protein binding,
cytokine activity, chemokine activity and metallopeptidase activity
were significantly enriched (Table 3). Among these top GO terms, cell
adhesion from BP, extracellular matrix from CC and protein binding
from MF were all involved in cell adhesion (Supplementary materials 2,
Figure S1), indicating their important roles during embryo invasion in
mink. Genes such as CSF3, IL (IL1B, IL6, IL8, IL3RA), CCL (CCL13,
CCL15, CCL8), CXCL (CXCL14, CXCL1, CXCL8), LAMA3 and LIF were
more highly expressed in IMs compared to inter-IMs.

4.1. Genes related to immune response
The functional category of immune response was highly over-represented in IMs compared to inter-IMs of the uterus (Table 2). This is
in agreement with many previous reports that have found the presence
of immune cells at the IMs and establishment of a favorable environment, including the production of cytokines and the expression of adhesion molecules, regulating the invasion of fetal cytotrophoblast cells
[26]. Studies with murine models lacking natural killer (NK) cells
suggests important roles for immune response in spiral arteriole remodeling and decidualization [27]. Aborted placentas expressed fewer
immune-related genes than successful placentas [28]. Several transcriptome analyses in other animals have shown that immune response
is among the top ranked enriched terms in IMs compared to inter-IMs
[16,19], highlighting the importance of immune response during embryo implantation.
In the present study, we observed 18 DEGs associated with immune
response. Upregulated genes including the interleukin family (IL6,
IL1B), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL15, CCL13, CCL8), chemokine
(C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL14, CXCL1, CXCL8), CD molecular (CD1),
Septin 9 (SEPT9), HOP homeobox (HOPX), Colony stimulating factor 3
(CSF3), Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Apelin (APLN). Negatively
regulated immune system genes included WDR78, NFKBID, IL3RA and
TTC3. LIF is known as a candidate gene regulating litter size in pigs
[29]. A study in rhesus monkeys indicated that uterine administration
of anti-LIF mAb leads to reduced pregnancy rates [30], while mutations
in the LIF gene in humans cause reduced fertility [31], LIF may function
by controlling the proportions and numbers of immune cells in the
endometrium at the time of implantation. Knocking out the LIF gene
reduced the number of endometrial macrophages, and increased the
number of NK cells and ecosinophils [32].
Chemokines are a group of small cytokines that are expressed on
both sides of the foeto-maternal interface, they can increase leukocyte
adhesion to the endothelium through the up-regulation of adhesion
molecules and hence promote leukocyte extravasation. In our study,
chemokines were up-regulated in IMs compared to inter-IMs in agreement with studies using murine models [16]. Prior studies in human
have shown that CXCL8, CXCL1 and IL6 induce trophoblast migration
and invasion into deciduas [33,34], so downregulation of these cytokines in the placenta may be responsible for fetal loss and fetal growth
retardation. In contrast to other studies in mice and marsupials, we did
not see a change in gene expression for immunoglobulins or the CD
molecule [35–37], even though these genes are expressed in other tissues in mink.

3.3. KEGG pathways analysis of DEGs
KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was done for DEGs and
P < 0.05 was used as a cutoff. A total of 214 enriched pathways were
found between the IMs and inter-IMs groups. The classifications indicated that cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction (Supplementary
materials 3, Figure S2), Jak-STAT signaling pathway (Supplementary
materials 4, Figure S3), TNF signaling pathway (Supplementary materials 5, Figure S4) and chemokine signaling pathway were highly enriched in IMs comprared to inter-IMs. The top 10 KEGG pathways are
shown in Table 4.
3.4. qRT-PCR validation of RNA-Seq
To validate the RNA-Seq results, we selected the top DEGs and the
genes in the top GO/KEGG pathway, which may play an important role
during embryo invasion in mink. The expression trends of these genes
determined by qRT-PCR showed good agreement with the RNA-seq
results (Fig. 1), all of them reaching the significance level of P < 0.05.
3.5. PPI network construction
We used STRING to obtain PPI relationships. The nodes of degree
≥5 were selected, and finally we obtained a gene network consisting of
120 nodes and 324 edges (Supplementary materials 6, Figure S5). The
genes CSF3 (colony stimulating factor 3), ICAM1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), FOS (proto-oncogene protein c-fos), IL1B (interleukin
1, beta), IL8 (interleukin 8), CD14 (monocyte differentiation antigen
CD14) and MYC (myc proto-oncogene protein) with high connectivity
degree were selected as the hub nodes and thus might play important
roles in embryo invasion in mink (Fig. 2).
4. Discussion
In this study, we report application of RNA-Seq to identify mechanisms and pathways while the embryo is invading into the endometrium in mink. 606 DEGs were identified at the IMs compared to

The degree to which trophoblasts cells invade maternal tissue
during placentation depends on how well they can degrade and remodel the extracellular matrix. In our current study, the function category of ECM complex enriched 13 DEGs between IMs and inter-IMs,
with 10 genes upregulated and 3 genes downregulated in IMs compared
to inter-IMs. Upregulated genes included ADAMTS4, MMP7, ADAMTS8,
S100A12, COL15A1, ADAM8, MMP8, ADAMTS9, MMP13, CASK, and
downregulated genes included PLCH, MIB2 and C1QTNF7. A disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) with thrombospondin motifs
(ADAMTSs), which are traditionally thought to control ECM proteolysis, were found to be highest in the pregnant uterus around the time of
implantation and spatially highest at the site of implantation [38]. In
human placentas, ADAMTS4 and 5 were most highly expressed in the
first trimester when placental invasion is most pronounced [39].
ADAMTS9 increases in the mouse uterus during implantation and
mainly localized to the vascular endothelial cells of the endometrium
[40]. Although the ADAMTS subtype was found to be over-expressed
during embryo implantation, the possible mechanisms and pathways
during trophoblast cell invasion and function need further investigation.
Matrix metallopoteinases (MMPs) play critical roles in controlling
invasion by trophoblast cells. MMP-7 and -8 were found in human early
pregnancy decidual stromal cells and extravillous cytotrophoblasts, and
MMP7 expression was decreased in women with recurrent implantation
failure compared with those exhibiting normal fertility [41]. A study in
rats showed that MMP7 was increased in IMs compared to inter-IMs
[42]. However, MMP8 and MMP13 have not been detected in the preor peri-implantation mouse uterus [43,44]. MMP13 was only found in
human extravillous cytotrophoblasts. Little information was gathered
about the function and mechanism of MMP subtypes on embryo invasion and implantation, so more work needs to be done to verify if they
are necessary during embryo implantation.
4.3. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction
In our study, the significantly differentially expressed cytokines
between IMs and inter-IMs included the CXC subfamily (IL8RB, IL8,
CXCL14), CC subfamily (CCL13, CCR1, CCL8), hematopoietins (IL6,
IL11, OSMR, LIF, CSF3, CSF3R), IL-3RB (IL3RA), PDGF family (HGF),
TNF family (TNFRSF21, TNFRSF12A), TGF-β family (IL1B), and IL-17
family (IL17RA). CXCL14 was reported to be involved in chemo-attraction, angiogenesis and cancer [45]. Targeted deletion of the
CXCL14 gene in the pregnant mouse uterus impaired the population of
uNK cells [46], which are considered to regulate trophoblast invasion
by production of IL8 and interferon-inducible protein-10 chemokines
[47]. Kuang [48] also revealed that CXCL14 was significantly upregulated at IMs compared to inter-IMs on pregnancy day 5 in mice. The
levels of IL8, IL6 and IL17 were shown to be higher in normal fertile
human endometrial cells than in uteri from patients with repeated
implantation failure uteri [49]. CSF3 (colony-stimulating factor3),
which is secreted from both immune and placental trophoblast cells,
acts through specific membrane receptors, via JAK-STAT signaling
pathways in an endocrine, paracrine or autocrine manner [50]. Studies
have shown that CSF3 is important in promoting proliferation of trophoblast cells [51]. Administration of the cytokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), prevents immune-mediated abortions in mice and improves pregnancy rates in women with a
history of recurrent abortions [51,52], however, the specific pathway
and mechanism of this effect is not clear.

included the prolactin signaling pathway, GnRH signaling pathway,
ovarian steroidogenesis, and insulin signaling pathway. The effects of
prolactin are mediated by a membrane bound receptor (PRLR), through
which prolactin stimulates Jak/STAT and ERK/MAPK pathways to influence glandular epithelia function/secretions. Prolactin has been reported to induce termination of obligate diapause in mink [53]. Prolactin receptor is expressed in the endometrium, and its abundance is
influenced by ovarian steroids [54]. PRLR mRNA and protein are low
during diapauses and early reactivation of embryos but increased
around the time of implantation [9], Prolactin could upregulate its own
receptors in the mink uterus [54]. Several studies have shown that in
mink uterine epithelial cells treated with prolactin, uterine polyamine
levels were altered, and their in vitro coculture increased embryo survival and attachment [9]. Five DEGs were significantly enriched in
prolactin signaling pathway, including ESR2, TH, SOCS5, FOS and
MEK1. The estrogen of ovarian origin that supports implantation in the
mouse uterus acts through the estrogen receptor-β(ESR2), and null
mutations for genes encoding Esr2 have confirmed the critical contribution of steroid signaling for endometrial receptivity and implantation [55]. In rat model, the ability of the corpus luteum to respond to estrogen requires prolactin [56]. Recently Gubbay et al.,
demonstrated, Prolactin also induces the ERK/MAPK pathway within
the secretory phase of the human endometrium [57], In the ERK/MAPK
cascade, MEK1 and MEK2 are dual-specificity kinases responsible for
the activation of the ERK1 and ERK2 kinases. Inactivation of Mek1
causes placental malformations resulting from defective proliferation
and differentiation of the trophoblast cells and leading to a severe delay
in the development and the vascularization of the mouse placenta,
which explains the embryonic death [58]. However, these mechanisms
have not yet been reported in mink.

Previous studies have shown that vascular development in attachment sites is essential for successful embryonic implantation, formation
of the placenta and fetal development [59]. In the functional analysis,
we observed that genes detected at a greater abundance in IMs than

physiologic milieu for implantation of the embryo and early placentation. Acquired diseases or perturbations of the maternal physiology
during embryo implantation, especially during the crucial early placentation period, can affect endometrial function and fetal development. More research efforts are needed to amplify and validate the
current study with details of the localization and function of important
genes and proteins, which may provide a more precise understanding of
trophectoderm proliferation, differentiation and invasion, as well as
fetus-maternal interactions and promotion of successful pregnancy in
mink.

inter-IMs related to vascular development, e.g., mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase 1 (MAP2K1), interleukin 1 (IL1B), apelin (APLN),
angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) and metallopeptidase inhibitor family
(TIMP1). MAP2K1 encodes dual specificity kinases responsible for ERK/
MAP kinase activation, and in mice, loss of MAP2K1 function causes
embryonic lethality due to placental defects. It has been reported that in
sheep the VEGF- and FGF2-stimulated fetoplacental artery endothelial
cell proliferation is mediated via the MAP2K1 and phosphoinositide 2kinase (PI3K)/AKT1 signaling pathways [60].

4.6. Regulatory network analysis

Appendix A. Supplementary data

In the present study, we identified 7 hub genes, which are likely
more important than other genes due to their key positions in the
network. These genes are CSF3, ICAM1, FOS, IL1B, IL8, CD14 and MYC.
Among these genes, CSF3, IL8 and IL1B are involved in immune response according to the GO function classification. Proto-oncogene FOS
is a transcription factor that encodes nuclear proteins known to be involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, and it may have a critical function in cellular interactions that regulate embryonic development [61]. In studies on mice, c-myc protein levels at IMs was much
higher than at inter-IMs [62]. c-myc expression was lower in preeclampsia than those in normal pregnancy further supports its important role during embryo implantation [63]. c-myc is up-regulated by
prolactin through the PI3K/AKT pathway [64]. In the KEGG database,
myc is downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway and regulates cell cycle
progression. Further study needs to be done to identify the role and
pathway of myc in embryo invasion and implantation. ICAM1 is intercellular adhesion molecule, expressed on endothelial cells, where
they bind to β2-integrin ligands on leukocytes [65]. In a study on rats,
ICAM1 increased at the time of implantation, suggesting a cell adhesion
role in embryo-uterine interaction [66]. CD14, a glycoprotein receptor,
has a relevant role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated cellular activation [67]. It has been reported that LPS amplified the inflammatory
response by inducing CD14 expression in endometrial glands [68].

5. Perspectives
The results of IMs and inter-IMs transcriptome profiling described
here indicate that multiple regulatory pathways are activated during
embryo invasion into the endometrium. And as a result failure of implantation, several of the genes and pathways identified as being involved in pathological states, including staphylococcus aureus infection, prion diseases, legionellosis, African trypanosomiasis, salmonella
infection, amebiasis and cancer, may contribute to endothelial dysfunction. In addition to genes involved in the regulation of the maternal
immune system, cell adhesion, migration and invasion, nutrient transport, cell proliferation, apoptosis, proteolysis and angiogenesis, these
molecular dysregulations in the endometrium may result in abnormal
placentation. Hormones stimulate the formation of a suitable
