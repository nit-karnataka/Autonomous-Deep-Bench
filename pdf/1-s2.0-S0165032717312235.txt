Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a rapid acting and eﬀective treatment for both major depressive
disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BP). Both propofol and ketamine are commonly used anesthetic agents but
recent clinical studies suggest that ketamine has rapid-acting antidepressant properties, itself, at sub-anesthetic
doses.
Methods: A total of 77 inpatients (41 MDD and 36 BP) were randomly assigned to receive ECT with propofol
(1 mg/kg) anesthesia or with ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) plus propofol (0.5 mg/kg). Depressive symptoms were assessed with the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24) and Montgomery–Asberg Rating Scale
(MADRS), before and after 1, 2, 4, and 6 ECT treatments, and 1–4 weeks following the last treatment. The
MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) was evaluated at baseline,after the sixth ECT, and 1–4 weeks
following the ﬁnal ECT. Adverse eﬀects were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks after the last treatment.
Results: There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in depressive symptoms, MCCB performance, or adverse eﬀects
between the treatment groups at any time. The electrical dose required to generate seizures in the ketamine plus
propofol group was lower than that of the propofol only group at every time point. The seizure energy index and
seizure duration in the ketamine plus propofol group was higher and longer than those in the propofol only
group.
Limitations: The diagnoses of MDD and BP were unevenly distributed across treatment groups.
Conclusions: Ketamine plus propofol anesthesia in the ECT treatment of MDD and BP was not superior on any
measure to propofol alone.

1. Introduction
Depressive disorders, including both Major Depressive Disorder
(MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BP) are severe and chronic psychiatric
illnesses that are associated with substantial morbidity and high health
care costs, aﬀecting approximately 350 million people worldwide each
year (Oremus et al., 2015). The World Health Organization has predicted that depression will become the second largest cause of disability
worldwide in 2020, with its highest prevalence among adolescents
(Bayati et al., 2009). Psychopharmacological treatments, psychotherapy, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have all been widely
used to treat MDD and BP. However, the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study found that a majority of
patients do not achieve clinical remission after the ﬁrst treatment and
many become treatment resistant (Trivedi et al., 2006). Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) had been demonstrated to be an eﬀective

therapy for major depressive disorder (Martensson et al., 2013), with a
response rate of approximately 79%, and a remission rate of 75% (Tang
et al., 2012). There is some evidence that adequate seizure duration and
higher doses of electricity are essential to optimize the antidepressant
eﬀects of this treatment (Boylan et al., 2000). Propofol is a commonly
used sedative and anesthetic agent for ECT. However, it has potent
anticonvulsant properties, and thus may impact the quality of the induced seizure and hamper the eﬀectiveness of ECT treatment (Bundy
et al., 2010).
Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, is a non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Ketamine is
a well-known anesthetic agent, and recent clinical studies have shown
that it can also produce rapid antidepressant eﬀects in subanestehetic
doses among patients suﬀering from depressive symptoms from either
MDD or BP (Berman et al., 2000; Diazgranados et al., 2010; Seraﬁni
et al., 2014). Ketamine has also been found to reduce suicidality in

consecutive weeks for a total of six treatments. No antipsychotic or
antidepressive drugs were prescribed to the patients during the period
of delivering ECT. The two groups ﬁrst received atropine sulfate (1 mg).
Then, they received propofol (1 mg/kg) alone, or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg)
plus propofol (0.5 mg/kg) I.V. push for ECT anesthesia. Succinylcholine
(1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously to all patients as a muscle

treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Robust and rapid antidepressant
eﬀects have been observed after a single intravenous dose of ketamine
(0.5 mg/kg) (Zarate et al., 2006) with beneﬁts becoming apparent
within 2 h after infusion and with thirty-ﬁve percent of subjects
maintaining their response for at least 1 week (Zarate et al., 2006).
Ketamine has been used, speciﬁcally, in ECT anesthesia for many
years and, in view of its antidepressant eﬀects, may augment the
therapeutic beneﬁts of ECT (Loo et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2016).
Comparison of seizure duration, ictal EEG, and cognitive eﬀects of ketamine and methohexital anesthesia with ECT showed ketamine to be
well tolerated and associated with prolonged seizure duration, as well
as with fewer cognitive side eﬀects (Krystal et al., 2003). One previous
study suggested that use of ketamine anesthesia may improve the efﬁcacy of ECT as compared with propofol anesthesia (Okamoto et al.,
2010) while another reported that at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, given just
before electroconvulsive therapy, ketamine did not enhance antidepressant eﬀects (Abdallah et al., 2012).
Cognitive impairment is a common side eﬀect of ECT, and one that
is often observed after idiopathic grand mal seizures (MacPherson and
Loo, 2008). Both anterograde and retrograde amnesia are produced by
convulsive treatment in nonhuman primates (Moscrip et al., 2004).
There is also evidence that ketamine may increase synaptic signaling
proteins in the prefrontal cortex of rats (Li et al., 2010) and may thereby
reduce cognitive impairment during ECT.
This randomized double blind clinical trial compared ECT with
propofol anesthesia to ECT with ketamine and propofol together to
determine whether ketamine could augment the eﬀectiveness of ECT
when used an an anesthetic agent. Outcomes included antidepressant
eﬀects, ECT parameters, cognitive function and side eﬀects.

2.3. Assessment of depressive and psychotic symptoms and adverse eﬀects
The 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24)
(Hamilton, 1960) and the Montgomery–Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS)
(Montgomery and Asberg, 1979) were used to assess the severity of
depressive symptoms at baseline or 1 day before the ﬁrst ECT treatment, and 1 day after ECT treatments 1, 2, 4, and 6 and again 1–4
weeks following the last of the six treatments. The criterion for response
was ≥ 50% decrease in the HAMD-24 total score from baseline, while
the criterion for remission was having a MADRS total score ≤ 10.
Adverse events were documented during hospitalization by a psychiatrist.
2.4. Assessment of neurocognitive function
Neurocognitive functioning was assessed at baseline; after 6 treatments and 1–4 weeks following the last treatment by a trained neuropsychological technician using a subset of the MATRICS Consensus
Cognitive Battery (MCCB). The evaluation of all subjects followed
procedures described previously (Zhou et al., 2015). Brieﬂy, the Chinese version of the MCCB includes seven domains and nine subtests: (1)
Speed of Processing (SoP), consisting of three tests: Category Fluency,
Trail Making Test (TMT), and Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia: symbol coding (BACS SC); (2) Attention/Vigilance(AV),
using the Continuous Performance Test-Identical Pairs (CPT-IP); (3)
Working Memory(WM), using the Wechsler Memory Scale-III (WMS
III): Spatial Span; (4) Verbal Learning(Vrbl Lrng), using the Hopkins
Verbal Learning Test-RevisedTM (HVLT-RTM); (5) Visual Learning(Vis
Lrng), using the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised (BVMT-RTM);
(6) Reasoning and Problem Solving(RPS), using the Neuropsychological
Assessment Battery®, (NAB®): Mazes; and (7) Social Cognition(SC),
measured by the Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test
(MSCEITTM): Managing Emotions. The reliability and validity of the
Chinese version of the MCCB has been demonstrated previously (Shi
et al., 2013). Each domain score was standardized to a T score with a
mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. For the domain that includes
more than one test, a composite T score was calculated by averaging
standardized value of each test T score.

2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
Seventy-seven patients with clinical symptoms of depression were
enrolled in a randomized trial of anesthetic strategies for modiﬁed ECT
at the Department of Psychiatry of the Aﬃliated Brain Hospital of
Guangzhou Medical University (Guangzhou Huiai Hospital) between
June 2014 and October 2015. To be eligible, participants met diagnostic criteria for either major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar
disorder (BD), and were currently in a major depressive episode by ICD10 criteria that had not showed an adequate clinical response with at
least two antidepressant drugs of diﬀerent pharmacological classes at
adequate dosages for at least 6 weeks.
Patients were excluded if they had a primary psychiatric diagnosis
other than MDD or BD, such as schizophrenia and dementia; or current
severe physical illness or organic brain disease; as were those with other
contraindications for ECT or for anesthesia. The study was approved by
the ethics committee of the Aﬃliated Brain Hospital of Guangzhou
Medical University (Guangzhou Huiai Hospital). Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.

2.5. Statistical analysis
Baseline data are expressed as mean ± SD for continuous variables,
as number (%) for categorical variables. Analysis proceeded in several
steps. First, t-tests were used to compare treatment groups at baseline
on continuous measures. Chi-square tests were used to examine baseline diﬀerences in sex, diagnosis, family history, suicidal behavior, alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking.
Secondly, the group comparisons of follow-up data (the HAMD-24,
the MADRS, the treatment parameters of ECT, the T scores of MCCB and
the side eﬀects) were compared using linear mixed models which included terms for treatment group, time and the interaction of time and
treatment group and which were adjusted for diagnosis (BP or MDD)
which was included as a covariate. A power analysis was done to estimate the eﬀectiveness of sample size, which were performed using
PASS 11. A two-tailed p value < 0.05 was used as the criterion for
signiﬁcant group diﬀerences. All statistical analyses were performed
using SPSS version 18.0 for windows.

2.2. Treatment
ECT was performed using the Thymatron ® IV device (Somatics LLC,
Lake Bluﬀ, Illinois, USA) with bitemporal electrode placement. The
seizure threshold was estimated using the half-age method (% energy =
half current age) in each case (Chung and Wong, 2001). Seizure duration and the seizure energy index on the EEG were recorded during
anesthesia. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded just
before anesthesia and approximately 30 min following the ECT procedure. Patients were randomly assigned to receive propofol anesthesia
alone, or propofol plus ketamine based on double blind random assignment such that the raters and the patients were blind to the anesthetic agent.
ECT treatment was performed three times per week for two

3. Results
3.1. Demographic and clinical characteristics data
A total of 77 inpatients with depression who consented to ECT were
enrolled, including 41 (53.2%) with MDD and 36 (46.8%) with BP.
Patients were randomized into two groups, to received either propofol
anesthesia (n = 34) or ketamine plus propofol (n = 43). Twenty-one
patients (61.8%) in the propofol group and 15 (34.9%) patients in the
ketamine plus propofol group were diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
There were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in gender, age, years of education
and baseline depression scores between the two groups, although diagnoses was signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (p < 0.05) (Table 1).
3.2. Depression outcomes
Improvements in depressive symptom were observed with both
anesthetic regimens (see Fig. 1 and highly signiﬁcant time eﬀects in
Table 2), The power analysis showed that the time eﬀects power value
both was 1.000 for HAMD-24 scores and MARRDS scores. But there
were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between treatment groups (group eﬀect
in Table 2).
There was also no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between treatment groups
in the proportion who achieved remission at any time point. (Fig. 2A) or
in the proportions meeting criteria for response at any time point
(Fig. 2B). There was no signiﬁcant main eﬀect for the diagnostic covariate (BP vs MDD) in any analysis.
3.3. Cognitive function
No signiﬁcant diﬀerence was found on the MCCB between the
propofol group and the ketamine plus propofol group (Table 3). More
speciﬁcally there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the groups on
the T scores for any of the subscales of the MCCB. There was a signiﬁcant time eﬀect for Reasoning and Problem Solving(RPS) and Social
Congnition(SC) but no signiﬁcant group-by-time interaction eﬀects.

the anesthesia agent. The majority of patients in two groups reported
minimal transient adverse events, including rapid heartbeat and irritability. None of these side eﬀects were severe enough to require discontinuation of the ECT treatment.
4. Discussion
This randomized clinical trial showed no greater beneﬁts for the
ketamine-propofol combination in reducing symptoms of depression or
adverse cognitive eﬀects, and had no more serious side eﬀects except
for a modest increase in blood pressure. The ketamine plus propofol
group required a lower level of electric energy input, and showed increased seizure duration and a higher seizure energy index but, in the
ﬁnal analysis, ketamine plus propofol anesthesia in ECT for the treatment of depression in MDD and BP patients had no advantage over
propofol alone.
To place this study in context, we note that following the emergence
of strong evidence that subanesthetic doses of ketamine in both MDD
and BP has rapid and robust antidepressant eﬀects (Diazgranados et al.,
2010; Zarate et al., 2006), multiple case reports been to appear suggesting that using ketamine as the anesthetic for ECT might enhance its
therapeutic eﬃcacy and reduce adverse cognitive side eﬀects, possibly
by lengthening seizure duration and lowering electric energy requirements needed to induce seizures (Krystal et al., 2003; Loo et al., 2010;
McDaniel et al., 2006). However, since those preliminary reports, several randomized trials have yielded more negative or at best ambiguous
results. The majority of studies found no evidence that ketamine anesthesia neither improved depression outcomes nor reduced cognitive
side eﬀects of ECT. These negative results appeared both with ketamine
(0.8–1.0 mg/kg) alone (Rasmussen et al., 2014; Salehi et al., 2015; Yen
et al., 2015); and with ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) as an adjunct to either
thiopental (Abdallah et al., 2012) or profofol (Jarventausta et al.,
2013). In addition, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of
ketamine anesthesia augmentation in ECT suggested a lack of clinical
eﬃcacy. Data relating to remission (31.3% ketamine vs 28.8% control,
ns) and response rates (52.9% ketamine vs 57.6% control, ns) were
synthesized from 3 RCTs, indicating no diﬀerence in outcome with
ketamine anesthesia (McGirr et al., 2015). In contrast to these numerous negative trials one study found slightly greater antidepressant
eﬃcacy in the ﬁrst week of ECT treatment with adjunct ketamine
(0.5 mg/kg) anesthesia (Loo et al., 2012) and a second report found
better cognitive performance with ketamine (1.0–2.0 mg/kg) anesthesia compared to thiopental, when assessed with the mini mental
status examination (MMSE) (Yooseﬁ et al., 2014). Third report show
that a ketofol 1:1 mixture (43 ± 11 mg propofol, and 43 ± 11 mg ketamine) was associated with a longer mean seizure time and better
hemodynamic stability, without any important increased in side eﬀects
(Yalcin et al., 2012). In addition, two studies conducted in China both
reported that ketamine (0.8 mg/kg) alone or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg)
adjunct with propofol exhibited signiﬁcantly faster and superior antidepressant eﬀects with less severe cognitive side eﬀects (Wang et al.,
2012; Zhong et al., 2016). Since several other side eﬀects have frequently been reported with ketamine including headache, nausea, short
term delirum, restlessness and increased blood pressure (Rasmussen

p < 0.0010) showed progressively lower relative doses of electricity in
the ketamine plus propofol group.
3.5. Adverse events
Analysis of systolic and diastolic blood pressures both showed
higher values for the ketamine plus propofal group (F = 10.962, p =
0.001; F = 32.814, p < 0.001, respectively) although they were not in
a dangerous range (Table 5). There was no diﬀerence in heart rate and
breathing recovery time between two groups (Table 5). Analysis of
consciousness recovery time detected a main eﬀect of time (F = 3.941,
p < 0.01), but not group or group-by-time interaction.
During the six ECT treatments, no major adverse eﬀects were observed in patients who received ketamine plus propofol or propofol as

Even though several evaluations of ketamine anesthesia in ECT have
been published the present negative study was a rigorous double-blind
randomized clinical trial that was designed to compare two highly
salient study groups. While our ﬁndings support the general negative
trend in the literature, several distinctive strengths deserve comment.
First, we used an especially sophisticated neuropsychological battery,
the MCCB to evaluate cognitive changes after ECT treatment. This extensive set of neurocognitive tests could have been expected to bo more
sensitive in detecting adverse eﬀects as compared with neurocognitive
tests like the MMSE that have been used in some previous studies.
Secondly we measured symptoms and cognitive functions longitudinally, at 6 diﬀerent time point, from the pre-ECT baseline through
4 intermediate assesments to the ﬁnal assessment 1–4 weeks after the
ﬁnal ECT treatment. This a dynamic and more sensitive evaluation of
changes in depressive symptoms. Thirdly our study sample was relatively large and there was no loss of follow-up data. Since all

et al., 2014; Salehi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2012; Yen et al., 2015),
ketamine has been used at subanesthetic doses as an adjunct to low
dose propofol as a recommended ﬁrst choice in TRD patients (Wang
et al., 2012; Zhong et al., 2016). It is important to note that one study
did not support the use of adjunctive ketamine in routine ECT treatment
in the NHS (Anderson et al., 2017). The results of that study showed
that compared with saline, adjunctive ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) had no
signiﬁcant eﬀect on neuropsychological outcomes, improvement in
depression, the number of ECT treatments to remission, anxiety
symptoms or quality of life (Anderson et al., 2017). Our study, however,
provides further evidences that although stimulus intensity was signiﬁcantly reduced and seizure duration was longer, ketamine used
adjunctively with propofol neither enhances the antidepressant eﬀect of
ECT nor reduces the cognitive side eﬀects. These results suggest that the
antidepressant eﬀect of ECT is so pronounced and rapid acting that it
may mask any independent eﬀects of ketamine (Okamoto et al., 2010).

4.1. Limitations
Several limitation also deserve comment. Firstly, the study samples
were all from the same acute psychiatric hospital perhaps limiting the
generalizability of the results to other facilities. Second, since all participants were hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital, they may have had
more severe symptoms and more complicated presentations than patients treated on psychiatric wards of general hospitals or as outpatients. Thirdly diagnoses of MDD and BP were unevenly distributed
across treatment groups potentially biasing the results. Statistical adjustment ﬁr this imbalance did not change the results. Fourthly, a larger
dose of ketamine was not assessed in present study. A pilot dose-response trial of ketamine found that antidepressant eﬃcacy may be
dose-related (Lai et al., 2014). High doses may thus have led to more
positive results for the ketamine group. Finally, while the ECT treatment regimen of 6 treatments is widely accepted as adequate, some
practitioners would suggest that a more extensive course of ECT
treatments might have led to higher remission and response rates.
Whether ketamine anesthesia would have shown greater beneﬁt in the
context of a more extensive course of ECT treatment is not known but
may deserve further study. Thus there is still considerable scope for
further research, examining the relationship between antidepressant
eﬀect and dose of ketamine with large sample sizes.
5. Conclusion
Although ketamine-propofol anesthesia reduced the stimulus intensity and increased the seizure duration of ECT treatment it did not
enhance the speed or magnitude of antidepressant eﬀects nor signiﬁcantly reduce the cognitive impairment or other side eﬀects. Since
using a single agent may be simpler than using two, it may be preferable to use propofol alone as anesthesia for ECT except for those with
high seziure threshold.
