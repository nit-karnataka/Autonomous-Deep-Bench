CONCLUSION

To compare the outcomes of mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (m-PCNL) and retrograde
intrarenal surgery (RIRS) in treating renal stones in preschool-aged children.
Forty-five patients treated with m-PCNL and 32 patients treated with RIRS for renal stones were
compared retrospectively. The operative and postoperative outcomes of both groups were analyzed retrospectively.
The mean age and gender were similar between the groups. The mean stone size was 19.30 ± 4.21 mm
for the RIRS group and 21.06 ± 5.61 mm for the PCNL group (P = .720). The mean operative
times, fluoroscopy times, and hospitalization times were statistically higher in the PCNL group.
The stone-free rates (SFRs) after a single procedure were 84.4% in the PCNL group and 75% in
the RIRS group (P = .036). After auxiliary procedures, the overall SFRs reached 91.1% for the
PCNL group and 90.6% for the RIRS group (P = .081). No major complications were observed
for both groups. Minor complication (Clavien 1-3) rates were 15.5% and 12.5% for the PCNL
and RIRC group, respectively (P = .385).
RIRS has some advantages over PCNL such as shorter hospitalization times, shorter fluoroscopy
times, and shorter operative time in treating renal stones. However, PCNL achieves higher SFR
after a single session. UROLOGY 101: 21–25, 2017. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

hildhood urolithiasis is a common health problem
and accounts for a large proportion of pediatric morbidity and hospitalization in developing countries. Pediatric renal calculi are especially seen in endemic
countries such as Turkey and Pakistan.1 Unlike adult patients, underlying metabolic disorders or anatomical malformation or recurrent infections generally cause kidney
stone in pediatric age population. For this reason, pediatric patients are at high risk for recurrent stone disease and
may require multiple interventions.2
In recent years, with the advancement of miniaturization of urological instruments, minimally invasive techniques are used in the treatment of pediatric renal stones.
For years, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL),
mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL), micropercutaneous nephrolithotomy (micro-PCNL), and

retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) have been safely and
effectively used for the treatment of pediatric renal stones.
Mini-PCNL has been performed for larger stones and need
less ancillary procedures but have serious complications due
to the fragile parenchyma, small caliber collecting system,
and mobile kidney in pediatric patients.3 In comparison,
RIRS is a less invasive alternative method that has been
performed for smaller stones and may be performed in multiple stages in stones larger than 2 cm.4
In current literature, no previous study has examined
RIRS and mini-PCNL for patients’ below 6 years old. In
this study, we aimed to compare RIRS and mini-PCNL by
evaluating stone-free rates (SFRs) and complications in
preschool-aged children.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Seventy-seven patients aged ≤6 years old who underwent RIRS
(n = 32) or mini-PCNL (n = 45) for renal stones were reviewed
retrospectively between May 2013 and January 2016 in 2 tertiary referral centers in Turkey. Patients were classified individually as belonging to either the RIRS or the mini-PCNL group.
All surgeons could perform both types of surgery. Both hospitals
are high-volume centers and have surgeons with expertise

especially in pediatric renal stones. Patients were preoperatively evaluated for complete blood count, serum biochemistry,
and urine culture, and had coagulation tests. Urinary tract infection was treated according to the antibiogram results. Urinary
ultrasound, noncontrast tomography (NCCT), and/or intravenous pyelography were performed in all patients as an imaging
method. Stone size was accepted as the longest axis measured on
NCCT and in case of multiple stones, sizes were defined as the
sum of the longest diameter of each stone.
Patients’ age, stone size, fluoroscopy and operation time, SFRs,
stone composition, complication of each procedure, and hospitalization time were retrospectively analyzed.

Mini-PCNL Technique
All procedures were performed in standard prone position under
general anesthesia. A 4 Fr ureteric catheter was inserted via pediatric cystoscopy or semi-rigid ureteroscopy with fluoroscopy guidance. Percutaneous renal puncture was achieved with an 18 Ga
needle after displaying renal collecting system with contrast material. According to the stone size and age of children, tract dilation was performed up to 20 Fr or 22 Fr with Amplatz renal
dilator set. A 17 Fr rigid nephroscope and a pneumatic lithotripsy as an only energy source were used for surgery. Fluoroscopic imaging control to detect the residual fragment was
performed at the end of the surgery. Nephrostomy catheter was
inserted routinely in all patients and antegrade pyelography was
performed to check the location of nephrostomy tube and extravasation. Ureteral catheter and nephrostomy tube were removed
on postoperative day 1, 2, or 3 if there are no complications.

RIRS Technique
The procedures were performed under general anesthesia in frog
leg or lithotomy position in all patients. Firstly, semi-rigid
ureteroscopy was performed to insert the guidewire and to create
the ureteral dilation before placing the 9.5 Fr ureteral access sheath
(UAS). Ureteral orifice was passively dilated with double-J (DJ)
stent for 2-4 weeks if necessary. UAS was inserted over the
guidewire with fluoroscopy control. A 7.5 Fr flexible ureteroscope
(f-URS, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) was passed through the
UAS. If the UAS does not pass over the guidewire, we tried to
move the f-URS over the guidewire without access sheath. A DJ
stent was placed and the procedure was postponed for 2-4 weeks
in case of unsuccessful access to the renal collecting system with
or without UAS. In all cases, Holmium:YAG laser was used for
the stone fragmentation. Stones were fragmented into small pieces
less than 3 mm and left for spontaneous passage. Sometimes, nitinol
baskets were used to extract residual fragment only for stone analysis. Stone repositioning was performed for lower pole stones, with
nitinol basket in some patients. A double-J stent (3 Fr-4 Fr) was
placed at the end of the procedure. Ureteral catheter was inserted in selected cases with low stone burden <1 cm and in the
absence of residual fragmentation at the end of the surgery. DJ
stents were removed 2-4 weeks after the operation and ureteral
catheter was removed a day after the surgery.
All patients were evaluated with kidney-ureter-bladder for residual fragmentations and stent localization on the first postoperative day. Patients were reevaluated with ultrasound and kidneyureter-bladder or NCCT if ancillary treatment modality is necessary
at 3 months postoperatively. Procedures were accepted as stone
free when there are no residual fragmentations on radiological
imaging method at 3-month follow-up. Metabolic assessment was
performed in all patients at 1 month postoperatively.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 11.5 (IBM,
Armonk, NY). Demographic data, stone characteristic, operative technique, radiation time, complications, SFR, and hospital stay were compared between the 2 groups. Categorical and
continuous variables were compared with the chi-square test and
Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. Statistical significance was
defined as P < .05.

RESULTS
A total of 77 patients were included in this study: 45 patients in the mini-PCNL group and 32 patients in the RIRS
group. Male to female ratios in the mini-PCNL and RIRS
groups were 24:21 and 17:15, respectively. The mean age in
the mini-PCNL group and the RIRS group was 3.71 ± 1.89
(1.7 months-5.4 years) and 3.65 ± 1.95 (1.1-6 years), respectively (P = .835). The mean stone size was 21.06 ± 5.61 mm
in the mini-PCNL group and 19.30 ± 4.21 mm in the RIRS
group (P = .720). The mean hospitalization, operation, and
fluoroscopy times were 3.46 ± 1.77 days, 85.22 ± 12.87 minutes,
and 60.88 ± 23.38 seconds in the mini-PCNL group, and
1.2 ± 0.52 days, 46.25 ± 9.30 minutes, and 4.15 ± 1.98 seconds
in the RIRS group, respectively (P < .001). Initial SFRs in the
mini-PCNL group and the RIRS group were 84.4% and 75%,
respectively (P = .036). A total of 5 patients required additional intervention (2 ESWL, 2 RIRS, and 1 URS + DJ stent
placement) in the mini-PCNL group. Three out of these 5
patients were completely stone free and these additional procedures increased the overall success rate from 84.4% to 91.1%.
In the mini-PCNL group, 4 patients were followed up via ultrasonography for insignificant fragments. In the RIRS group,
SFR increased to 90.6% after the second intervention (3 reRIRS, 1 ESWL, and 1 URS + DJ stent placement) and 3 patients had asymptomatic residual fragments <4 mm in the
kidney.
In the RIRS group, 12 (37.5%) patients required passive
dilatation of the orifice with DJ stent. No active dilatation was performed. UAS was placed in 14 patients (43.7%).
A DJ stent was placed in all patients at the end of the
procedure.
No major (Clavien IV-V) complication was observed in
both groups. Overall, minor (I-III) complication rates in
the mini-PCNL group were higher but the differences were
not statistically significant (P = .385). Three (6.6%) patients required blood transfusion due to hemorrhage; bowel
perforation was seen in 1 patient, although there were no
retrorenal colon images in abdominal computed tomography and perforated area of descending colon was primarily repaired on postoperative day 2; and 1 patient had
hydrothorax due to retroperitoneal saline extravasation and
spontaneous resolution was observed after DJ stent insertion. Urinary tract infection was observed in 2 patients in
the mini-PCNL group. In the RIRS group, 3 patients had
urinary tract infection and required 14-day parenteral antibiotics; ureteral mucosal injury was observed in 1 patient
and a DJ stent was inserted, and the procedure was postponed for 4 weeks. During the follow-up, we did not observe

DISCUSSION
The incidence of renal stones in pediatric age population
ranges between 1% and 5%.5 Although kidney stones in
pediatric patients are an uncommon health problem, these
patients may require multiple interventions due to the repetitive nature of pediatric renal stones. Because of this,
minimal invasive treatment modalities like ESWL, miniPCNL, micro-PCNL, and RIRS have important roles in
pediatric stone treatment.6 All these modalities were compared with each other in adult patients. However, in pediatric patients there is not enough literature about the
comparison of these modalities. We compare the RIRS with
the mini-PCNL specifically in preschool-aged children in
the literature.
The first pediatric PCNL series were performed using
adult equipment in 1985. In these series, success rate was
similar but the complication and transfusion rates were
higher.7,8 To prevent the higher complication rates, Jackman
et al published the first mini-PCNL series in 1998. Eleven
procedures were performed with the 11 Fr sheath and the
7 Fr rigid cystoscope without any complication.9 In recent
literature, SFRs of the mini-PCNL ranged from 75% to
100%.7-11 Bodakci et al achieved a complete stone-free state
UROLOGY 101, 2017

in 81.2% of infant patients at the end of the postoperative
first week in 48 mini-PCNL procedures.12 In a prospective study of Kareem Daw et al, SFR after primary miniPCNL was 76.9% in 26 preschool-aged patients and infants.
SFR improved from 76.9% to 92.3% after ESWL.11 Guven
et al reported an SFR of 94.7% in 17 infants and all patients were stone free after additional procedures.13 In our
study, SFR was 84.4% and increased to 91.1% after additional procedures. In parallel to the literature on PCNL
in children, success rates in our study are similar in
preschool-aged patients.
Complications of the PCNL in pediatric age population are related to the caliber of the sheath and the number
of the tract. In the first mini-PCNL series, an 11 Fr caliber
sheath was used without any complication.9 Desai et al
showed that transfusion rate dramatically increased above
the 22 Fr dilatation so they recommended that the dilatation of the tract should be below 24 Fr.10 Celik et al
compared the pediatric PCNL with different-sized instruments. SFR was 78% with a 9.5 Fr nephroscope, 75.8%
with an 18 Fr nephroscope, and 71.4% with an 24 Fr
nephroscope. They showed that there was no significant
complication rate between the groups except transfusion
rates. Transfusion rates were significantly lower in the ultra–
mini-PCNL group.14 We dilate the renal tract up to 20 Fr
or 22 Fr with Amplatz renal dilator set according to the
stone size and age of children. In our opinion, the 22 Fr
sheath should be used in stones larger than 2 cm to improve
the SFR if the patient’s age and physical development
are appropriate.
Despite the high success rate of mini-PCNL, serious complications and higher transfusion rates have been reported to be associated with stone size, sheath caliber, and
tract number operative time.13,15 The transfusion rate ranged
from 4% to 23.9% in pediatric PCNL literature. Colon perforation and renal pelvis perforation have been reported
in some publications.11,12 In our study, there was no Clavien
4-5 complication and transfusion rate was lower than in
pediatric PCNL literature.16-18 This is because our experience has increased in pediatric patients due to the hospital localization in endemic stone region.

The first series of pediatric RIRS was published in 2007
by Cannon et al. The SFR was found to be 76% in this
study, but it is noteworthy that the majority of patients were
postpubertal.19 Kim et al reported SFR as 99% in 167 pediatric kidney stones. However, access sheath could not be
inserted in 57% of patients during the operation. In these
patients, passive dilatation with DJ stents was the preferred method of choice.20 In 2014, Erkurt et al published
one of the largest series of RIRS in preschool-aged pediatric population. SFRs after a single and second procedure were 83.07% and 92.3%, respectively. UAS was able
to be inserted in 61.5% of patients.21 In pediatric patients’ literature, complication rates of RIRS ranged between
0% and 27.7%. The most frequently observed complications were urinary system infection, postoperative hematuria, fever, ureteral mucosal injury and more severely
ureteral stricture, and ureteral perforation.22,23 In this study,
SFR was 75% and 90.6% after the first and second procedures, respectively, which is similar to current literature. UAS placement in the first session was lower compared
to literature because of the younger age of the patients.
Despite the high SFR of PCNL in a single session, it has
more serious complications than the RIRS procedure. Saad
et al compared the outcomes of PCNL and RIRS in large
pediatric kidney stones. They found that the SFRs of RIRS
and PCNL were 71% and 95.5%, respectively. This study
reveals lower SFR with RIRS vs PCNL for treatment of
large complex pediatric stones.24 Another comparative study
showed that SFRs for stones <20 mm and >20 mm in the
RIRS group were 87.3% and 50%, respectively; on the other
hand, SFRs for stones <20 mm and >20 mm in the PCNL
group were 100% and 83.9%, respectively. Resorlu et al
showed that the success rate of RIRS has increased in
inverse proportion to the stone size.4 In our study, SFR was
higher compared to these studies due to the smaller stone
size of patients.
Mean hospitalization time, operative time, and fluoroscopy time were found to be shorter in the RIRS group. Hospital stay was longer in the PCNL group. It is caused by
the drainage nephrostomy tube and ongoing postoperative pain. High radiation exposure, longer hospitalization
time, severe complications (Clavien 4-5), and postoperative pain can be significantly improved with a RIRS procedure with almost the same SFR.
The main limitation of the present study was it being
a retrospective study besides significant differences between
the stone sizes in both groups.

CONCLUSION
Although PCNL procedures have higher rates of severe
complications (Clavien 4-5) than RIRS for the treatment of preschool-aged kidney stones, initial SFRs in PCNL
were better than the RIRS procedure. On the other hand,
decreased radiation exposure, shorter hospital stay, and fewer
complication rates make RIRS a safe and effective alternative to mini-PCNL in preschool-aged patients.
