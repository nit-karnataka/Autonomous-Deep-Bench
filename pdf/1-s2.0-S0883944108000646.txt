Abstract “Expert” editorial opinion suggests that objective or quantitative neuromuscular monitors
should be used whenever nondepolarizing blocking agents are administered. It is clear that this advice
has by and large fallen on deaf ears. A sizeable number of clinicians here (North America) and abroad
(Europe) fail to use even conventional peripheral nerve stimulators routinely. This chapter will explore
potential reasons for and consequences of this disconnect between academia and “the real world.”
Along the way, we will examine such questions as how do we define and measure adequate recovery
from nondepolarizing block. What are the limitations of clinical tests of recovery such as the “head-lift
test?” What is the incidence of undetected postoperative residual curarization (PORC)? Does
neuromuscular monitoring reduce the frequency of PORC? How will the availability of sugammadex
alter the above discussion?

1. Introduction
Five years ago, an editorial in Anesthesiology opined: “…
it is time to move from discussion to action and introduce
objective neuromuscular monitoring in all operating rooms,
not just those occupied by researchers and aficionados of
muscle relaxants. …objective neuromuscular monitoring is an
evidence-based practice and should consequently be used
whenever a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent is
administered [1].” By “objective,” the author meant the use of
monitors that measured and displayed the train-of-four (TOF)
ratio in real time. A similar editorial call for objective or
quantitative monitoring in the British Journal of Anaesthesia
appeared 3 years earlier with the dictum that “At a minimum,
the clinician should always monitor the extent of neuromuscular recovery using objective means, whenever nondepolarizing neuromuscular block is not antagonized [2].”

Although these opinions probably represent the position
of most academic neuromuscular “experts,” it is clear that in
the real world of day-to-day practice, these suggestions have
been widely ignored. A recent survey in the United Kingdom
found that 62% of clinicians never use a peripheral nerve
stimulator of any kind, and less than 10% used an objective
monitor on a routine basis [3]. Studies from Denmark [4],
Germany [5], and Mexico [6] report that routine monitoring
of neuromuscular function was used by only 43%, 28%, and
2% of clinicians, respectively. This disconnect between
editorial opinion and actual clinical practice raises a question
of some importance. Is there a standard of care regarding the
administration of neuromuscular blockers that anesthesia
providers should be held to? The American Society of
Anesthesiologists offers no help. Their publication “standards for basic anesthesia monitoring” 1 makes no mention of
neuromuscular monitoring. This is a little strange because the

mission statement of the ASA that appears on the
organization's Web site states: “The ASA is an educational,
research, and scientific association…organized to raise and
maintain the standards of the medical practice of anesthesiology and improve the care of the patient.”
Does the failure to monitor neuromuscular function have
clinical consequences? In the absence of any “official”
guidance, a review of this question still seems relevant 50
years after the intraoperative use of nerve stimulators was
first suggested [7]. A prerequisite for this discussion is an
understanding of how satisfactory recovery from neuromuscular block is now measured.

2. How do we define adequate recovery of
neuromuscular function?
2.1. Clinical tests
In the decade after the introduction of d-tubocurarine into
anesthesia practice, the clinician's ability to recognize
residual neuromuscular block in the postoperative period
was very limited. In a 1959 review on the then current state
of the art of muscle relaxants, Cullen [8] wrote “In the
absence of any ventilatory effort by the patient, no
assessment (except by history) can be made of the cause
for the apnea.” Nevertheless, in that year, Bendixen et al [9]
suggested maximal negative inspiratory force was a useful
measure of ventilatory capacity and might represent a “vital
capacity measurement in the unconscious.” Early attempts at
defining bedside criteria for tracheal extubation and the
discontinuation of mechanical ventilation were usually
derived from tests of pulmonary function of patients in an
ICU setting [10]. Thus, then widely accepted criteria such as
the ability to generate a peak negative inspiratory force of
minus 25 to 30 cm H2O may have had applicability to the
unparalyzed patient recuperating from parenchymal pulmonary disease but probably should not have been applied to
healthy individuals recovering from nondepolarizing neuromuscular block. In addition, tests of pulmonary function
were often impossible to use in the clinical setting.
Clinicians needed a practical bedside test of muscle
strength that was simple to use in day-to-day practice. The
criteria that achieved the widest acceptance was the “5second head lift.” The concept for this test may be traced
back to the initial animal studies of d-tubocurarine by E.R.
Squibb pharmaceuticals [11]. Drug potency was assayed by
the rabbit head-drop test. The end point of the test was
relaxation of the neck muscles to such a degree that the
animal's head could not be raised or turned in response to a
physical stimulus. It is not clear who first suggested that this
test had clinical applicability, but in 1961, Dam [12] wrote
“…the muscles of the neck are among the first to be
influenced by the paralyzing action of muscle relaxants as
shown by the fact that conscious subjects when given small

doses of curare, which do not cause respiratory embarrassment are often unable to lift the head from the pillow.”
Shortly thereafter, Johansen et al [13] suggested that the
“head lift” was a more sensitive test of neuromuscular
recovery than either inspiratory/expiratory flows or pressures. Several years later, Pavlin et al [14] were able to
demonstrate in 6 healthy volunteers that all subjects who
could accomplish a head lift (HL) could perform airway
protective measures (ability to swallow, perform a Valsalva
maneuver, prevent airway obstruction). Head lift occurred at
an average maximal inspiratory force (MIF) of about −55 cm
H2O vs −45 cm H2O for airway protection. Nonetheless, it
should be noted that despite a successful HL considerable
weakness might still present. Control MIF values approximated −90 cm H2O, and at −60 cm H2O grip strength was
only 40% of control.
As early as 1970, evidence began to appear that
demonstrated that the HL test was not always a reliable
index of recovery from d-tubocurarine. Walts et al [15]
reported that despite a sustained 5-second head lift, 11 of 21
subjects had less than 90% return of vital capacity (average,
83%; range, 76%-86%), and 14 of 20 had less than 90%
return of maximal voluntary ventilation. In another study
evaluating “bedside tests” of neuromuscular recovery,
Hutton et al [16] concluded that compared to inspiratory
force, expiratory force, grip strength, or the presence of
diplopia, the 5-second HL proved to be a very insensitive test
of complete antagonism of residual block. Finally, it should
be stressed that all bedside tests require an awake and
cooperative patient. This was not a common occurrence in
the immediate postoperative period in the days when
halothane was considered a drug of low blood solubility.
More rigorous critiques of the 5-second HL correlating
this test with the TOF fade ratio will be presented later in
this chapter, but first, a brief review of the significance of
evoked muscle responses to peripheral nerve stimulation
may prove helpful.

2.2. Evaluating evoked responses
Although monitoring the evoked mechanical response to
peripheral nerve stimulation was first suggested in the late
1950s [7] and then again in the mid-1960s [17,18] as a means
of evaluating neuromuscular recovery, the first rigorous
studies of the effects of neuromuscular blockers on evoked
parameters (twitch height, tetanic fade, posttetanic potentiation) in man did not appear until several years later [19]. A
breakthrough in neuromuscular monitoring occurred in the
early 1970s with the description of the TOF stimulus [20,21].
Ali et al [22] pointed out that this sequence (4 single stimuli
at half-second intervals) gave a reproducible measure of
neuromuscular block without the necessity of first establishing control or baseline values. These authors were also able
to show a relationship between the TOF fade ratio with the
ability to perform a HL maneuver. They reported that a TOF
ratio of 0.60 guaranteed that subjects had the ability to lift

Neuromuscular monitoring
their heads for at least 3 seconds. However, a closer
inspection of their data (see Fig. 1) suggests a somewhat
different message. A 3-second or 5-second head lift does not
represent full recovery. A head lift more than 10 seconds
required a TOF ratio of at least 0.70.
Four years later, Ali and coworkers [23] published a
now classic study correlating the TOF ratio with 3
measurements of mechanical respiratory reserve (vital
capacity, negative inspiratory force, and peak expiratory
flow rate) in healthy volunteers (see Table 1). They
concluded that once the TOF ratio recovered to a value
of 0.70, “the magnitude of change in all variables was of
minor clinical importance…since the lowest measured
values were well above acceptable minimum limits required
for adequate respiratory function.” In a follow-up study
from the same department [24] in 10 ASA III or IV
patients, the authors agreed that a TOF ratio of 0.70
correlated well with clinical criteria used for tracheal
extubation (see Table 2). Thus, based on less than 2 dozen
subjects, a TOF ratio of at least 0.70 came to be accepted as
the benchmark for adequate recovery from nondepolarizing
neuromuscular block. This standard was not seriously
questioned for the next 20 years.
Although there is no reason to question the validity of data
of Ali [23], his study must be placed in the proper context.
This work was done in an era in which early patient discharge
from the hospital was uncommon. In 1975, ambulatory
surgery was in its infancy. A patient entering the hospital for
repair of an inguinal hernia was likely to remain an inpatient
for the better part of a week. In addition, rapid recovery of
cognitive function was less easily accomplished 30 years ago
when diethyl ether and methoxyflurane were still widely used

anesthetic agents. Thus, the issue of a patient's perceptions of
residual weakness in the immediate postoperative period was
not a pressing one. Today, in an environment where patients
may be discharged from the hospital within 2 to 3 hours of
leaving the operating room, the problem of lingering paresis
takes on greater relevance.
A discussion this author had with one of the subjects
in Ali's volunteer study (John Savarese, MD) is
instructive. He reported that at a time when his measured
TOF ratio was 0.70, he was unsteady on his feet, had
difficulty in climbing stairs, and experienced a feeling of
generalized muscular weakness and fatigue. This conversation prompted us to investigate the signs and subjective
symptoms that might accompany previously “acceptable”
levels of neuromuscular block [25]. We studied 10 unsedated
healthy young volunteers in whom the TOF fade ratio was
recorded while receiving a mivacurium infusion titrated to
TOF ratios of 0.60 to 0.70. Although no volunteer required
intervention to maintain a patent airway and the oxygen
hemoglobin saturation (room air) was at least 96% at all
times, even small decrements in the TOF ratio were
accompanied by significant signs and symptoms of muscular
weakness. At TOF ratios less than 0.75, all subjects were
uncomfortable, none considered themselves even remotely
“street ready.” Most reported that speaking required a great
effort and that swallowing had become difficult. Several
found it impossible to sip water through a straw because
they could not maintain a tight seal with their lips. At a TOF
ratio of 0.70, grip strength was decreased in all subjects. At

a TOF ratio of 0.70, grip strength averaged only 57% of
control, with a range of 43% to 77%. This increased to 83%
of control (range, 70%-105%) at a TOF ratio of 0.90.
Before mivacurium administration, all subjects could easily
prevent a wooden tongue depressor clenched between their
incisor teeth, from being pulled out by even a vigorous
effort on the part of the investigator. This ability did not
return until the TOF ratio exceeded on average a value of
0.85. Train-of-four ratios less than 0.90 were also accompanied by significant visual disturbances. Below this level
of recovery, every individual complained of diplopia and
difficulty in tracking moving objects. Symptoms often
persisted despite complete return of the TOF ratio to control
values. Kopman's results confirm an earlier report by
Russell [26] that demonstrated that hand grip was a more
sensitive marker of residual weakness than the HL. After
reversal of either d-tubocurarine or pancuronium, grip
strength did not approach control values until 1 hour after
all patients had successfully performed a 5-second HL.
Thus, from the patient's perspective, “satisfactory” neuromuscular recovery required return of the TOF ratio to a
value more than 0.90.
Nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs may
have other undesirable effects at TOF ratios as high as
0.90. There is convincing evidence that even partial
neuromuscular block (TOF of 0.70) impairs the ventilatory
response to hypoxia suggesting an effect of nondepolarizing relaxants on carotid body hypoxic chemosensitivity
[27]. Sundman et al [28] have also demonstrated that TOF
ratios less than 0.90 are associated with functional
impairment of the muscles of the pharynx and upper
esophagus. Resting upper esophageal muscle tone is
significantly decreased, and the coordination required
between esophageal sphincter relaxation and contraction
of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles necessary for the act
of deglutition becomes dysfunctional. Their subjects
showed misdirected swallowing with episodes of aspiration
(penetration of contrast media into the laryngeal vestibule
to the level of the vocal cords) with increasing frequency
as the level of neuromuscular block intensified (8%, 25%,
and 33% at TOF ratios of 0.80, 0.70, and 0.60,
respectively). Thus, based on available evidence, return
to a TOF ratio of 0.70 can no longer be considered optimal
or even adequate neuromuscular recovery. The modern
standard of recovery is now considered to be a TOF ratio
of at least 0.90.

2.3. The HL vs the TOF ratio
At what TOF fade ratio can the 5-second HL be
successfully performed? Kopman et al [25] found that the
test was passed at an average TOF value of 0.62 ± 0.09
(range, 0.48-0.75; n = 10). However, the literature does not
provide a clear-cut answer to this question (see Table 3)
[29-33]. What is clear is that many individuals can sustain
a 5-second HL at TOF values less than 0.60. Thus, Hutton

[16] was certainly correct when he deemed the HL to be
an insensitive test of neuromuscular recovery.

3. Postoperative residual curarization is not a
rare occurrence
Almost 3 decades ago, Viby-Mogensen and coworkers
[34] measured the prevalence of significant residual curarization in the recovery rooms of 3 university hospitals in
Copenhagen. On different days chosen at random, these
investigators studied every patient who received a nondepolarizing relaxant during anesthesia. The TOF fade ratio was
determined immediately after arrival in the recovery area. Of
50 patients given neostigmine, 2.5 mg intravenously, at the
end of anesthesia, 10 individuals (20%) had TOF ratios of less
than 0.60, and in 6 patients, the ratio was less than 0.40. These
findings have been confirmed by many other investigators
[29,35]. However, all of Viby-Mogensen's patients received
traditional long-acting neuromuscular blockers (eg, d-tubocurarine, pancuronium). A subsequent study with agents of
intermediate action suggested that the incidence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC) was significantly
lower in patients receiving these relaxants [36]. Thus, it was
assumed by some that as long-acting agents were gradually
replaced by newer drugs the incidence of PORC would
markedly decrease. It has not worked out that way. Recent
studies (the year 2000 or later) report that the incidence of
PORC may actually be greater than the value reported by
Viby-Mogensen. Frequencies of PORC range from a low of
16% of individuals arriving the in postanesthesia care unit
(PACU) with TOF values less than 0.70 after a single dose of
relaxant [37] to as high as 70% of patients who at the time of
extubation still have TOF values less than 0.70 [38]. Other
reports are equally alarming [39-41]. Why is PORC still such
a common occurrence? Clearly, a high level of unwarranted
complacency exists with regard to the ease of neostigmineinduced reversal of intermediate-duration neuromuscular
blocking agents (see Dr Caldwell's chapter in this issue of
Seminars). Much higher multiples of the ED (effective
dose)95 are now being administered than when traditional
long-acting agents were the only nondepolarizing relaxants
available. However, several other factors no doubt play a role.

Neuromuscular monitoring
As noted above, many clinicians still do not routinely use
even simple peripheral nerve stimulators (PNS) in the
perioperative period. The reasons behind this disdain for
neuromuscular monitoring escape this author, but I suspect in
part it reflects ignorance of the limitations of traditional
“bedside” tests such as the HL and tidal volume in detecting
residual muscle weakness. Clinicians do not seem to believe
that PORC is a clinical problem that may affect their patients.
Unfortunately, conventional PNS units even when they are
used have real limitations. Subjective tactile or visual
estimates of the TOF ratio are notoriously inaccurate. In
fact, most clinicians cannot detect the presence of fade once
the TOF ratio exceeds 0.40 [42]. Finally, in many academic
centers routine reversal of neuromuscular block is still the
exception rather than the rule [5,37].

3.1. Does residual neuromuscular block have
clinical consequences?
In a 1985, editorial Miller [43] noted “There are…no
outcome data assessing the role of residual paralysis…when
the occasional case of airway obstruction or the inability of
dispose of vomitus or oropharyngeal secretions occurs in the
recovery room.” Two decades later, despite the high
incidence of residual paresis found in most PACUs, there
is still remarkably little outcome information to suggest that
this represents a frequent cause of major morbidity. As
pointed out by Shorten [44], several factors work against
obtaining reliable information. First, it is unlikely that most
postoperative complications can be attributed to a single
cause. Second, an ethical dilemma exists. If postoperative
neuromuscular function is judged to be inadequate, the
investigator is obliged to intervene and in doing so has
altered the course that otherwise would have transpired.
Finally, the incidence of serious adverse events associated
with the administration of muscle relaxants is unknown but
probably small. How then do we determine if consequential
differences in outcome exist between various relaxant
regimens? In practice, it may not be possible to do so. For
example, assuming that protocol X has a true adverse effect
rate of 1 in 500, whereas for protocol Y, this frequency is 1 in
1500; more than 10000 subjects would have to be studied to
show that this difference had statistical significance. Massive
studies of this magnitude are rarely carried out.
Nevertheless, some information is available. Arbous et al
[45] were able to demonstrate that reversal of neuromuscular
block at the end of surgery was associated with decreased risk
of 24-hour mortality or coma (odds ratio, 0.10). There is also
convincing evidence that postoperative pulmonary complications are more common when long-duration vs intermediateduration nondepolarizing blockers are administered [46-48].
In a recent prospective study of 70 patients scheduled for
orthopedic surgery, Murphy et al [49] compared adverse
recovery room outcomes in patients who had received
pancuronium vs rocuronium intraoperatively. Forty percent

15
of patients in the pancuronium group had TOF ratios less than
0.7 on arrival to the PACU, compared with only 6% of subjects
in the rocuronium group. Patients in the pancuronium group
were more likely to experience symptoms of muscle weakness
(blurry vision and generalized weakness) and hypoxemia (10
patients in the rocuronium group vs 21 patients in the
pancuronium group) during the PACU admission. Significant
delays in meeting PACU discharge criteria and achieving
actual discharge were observed when the pancuronium group
was compared with the rocuronium group.
In the absence of additional “hard” outcome data, how
should we proceed when drawing conclusions regarding the
risks associated with residual paresis in the PACU? We often
are forced to accept surrogate measures as a substitute for
true outcomes [50,51]. The TOF ratio is one such surrogate.
There is convincing evidence that TOF values less than 0.80
result in measurable decreases in mechanical respiratory
reserve [23], decreased ventilatory response to hypoxia [27],
an impaired ability to swallow, and protect the upper airway
from aspiration [52] and numerous subjective complaints
[25]. I find it difficult to accept the position that none of
this matters.

4. Does neuromuscular monitoring reduce
the incidence of postoperative
residual curarization?
It is a bit odd that, 50 years after the use of peripheral
nerve stimulators were first suggested [7] as aids in
monitoring neuromuscular function, use of these instruments
is even being discussed. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these
devices in preventing postoperative residual curarization is
still a matter of controversy. “Common sense” suggests that
even nonquantitative conventional PNS units that require a
subjective evaluation of the evoked response should prove
superior to “clinical” tests especially when the patient is
uncooperative with the assessment. A recent meta-analysis
that examined this hypothesis, however, found that the peerreviewed literature does not necessarily support this premise
[53]. The authors confirmed that the incidence of PORC was
higher when long-acting neuromuscular blockers were
administered. However, they could not demonstrate that
the use of an intraoperative neuromuscular function monitor
decreased the incidence of PORC. Because this conclusion is
so counterintuitive it needs to be discussed in some detail.

4.1. Conventional (nonobjective)
neuromuscular monitoring
Unfortunately, in Naguib's meta-analysis, most of the
studies cited that failed to demonstrate that monitoring had a
favorable effect in reducing PORC were poorly designed to
do so. Examples of which are the following:

Pedersen et al [54] studied patients who received either
vecuronium or pancuronium. In half of the patients, the
degree of intraoperative blockade was assessed by tactile
evaluation of the TOF response at the thumb. In the other
half, the degree of block was evaluated solely by clinical
criteria. The use of a PNS had no effect on the dose of
relaxant given during anesthesia or on the incidence of
postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade evaluated
clinically. In the clinical criteria groups, reversal of residual
paralysis was not attempted until spontaneous respiration or
other indication of muscle activity was observed. However,
the authors' protocol almost guaranteed that results in the
monitored group would be less than optimal. Anesthetists
were instructed to maintain the TOF count at 1 or 2
detectable responses and antagonism of residual block with
neostigmine was initiated at this level of block. There is
ample evidence that prompt and satisfactory anticholinesterase-induced antagonism at this level of block is simply
not a realistic goal. Intraoperative neuromuscular monitoring should be used to help the clinician titrate doses of
relaxant to avoid this level of block at the end of surgery,
not the converse. The same criticism can be applied to a
larger study by Fawcett et al [55]. No attempt was made to
influence the conduct of anesthesia, the choice of blocking
drug, or whether a neuromuscular function should be
monitored. The TOF ratios were measured upon arrival in
the PACU. The incidence of PORC was not decreased in
patients in whom a PNS device was used. The virtue of this
study is that it probably accurately reflected the thencurrent clinical practice of the authors' department. Its
weakness is that it gives the reader no insight into how
clinical decisions were made. If monitored patients were
routinely kept at TOF counts of 2 or fewer detectable
responses, then one may argue that use of a PNS might
actually have been counterproductive.
Hayes et al [40] focused on the frequency of PORC on
arrival in the PACU in patients who received vecuronium,
atracurium, or rocuronium. Residual block was considered
present in patients with a TOF ratio of less than 0.80. The
overall incidence of PORC was 52%. Intraoperative
neuromuscular monitoring was used in only 41% of patients,
and reversal of residual block was omitted in one third of the
patients. The authors were not able to demonstrate that the
incidence of PORC was significantly less in patients in
whom a PNS was used. Nevertheless, because several of
their patients (no PNS device used) arrived in the PACU with
TOF counts of less than 4 detectable responses, it is difficult
to accept the premise that even rudimentary monitoring
would not have been helpful.
I would argue that articles such as those cited above
expose a basic lack of knowledge on the part of clinicians
more than they indicate a lack of use of conventional PNS
devices. Although it is true that subjective evaluation of the
TOF ratio is subject to considerable error [42], the tactile
TOF count is a very useful parameter. If the TOF count at the
time reversal is initiated is known, the clinician at least has a

rough “ball park” estimate of when satisfactory return of
neuromuscular may be expected. If the TOF count has
recovered to one detectable responses after the administration of cisatracurium or rocuronium, then neostigmine, 0.05
mg/kg, will take approximately 20 minutes will restore the
TOF ratio to a value of about approximately 0.80 (with
considerable individual variation) [56]. If the count has
return to 2 palpable responses, then this time interval is
reduced to about 15 minutes [57]. In practical terms, the
maximum depth of block that can be promptly (≤10
minutes) reversed by anticholinesterase antagonists approximately corresponds to the reappearance of the fourth
response to TOF stimulation [58,59].
This author firmly believes that nondepolarizing relaxants
can be administered quite safely to the most patients without
using objective neuromuscular monitors. If drug administration is timed so that the TOF count is 3 or 4 when antagonism
is initiated, then clinically significant PORC in the recovery
room should be a rare event. However, there are circumstances where objective monitors are clearly preferable to
conventional PNS units.

4.2. The case for objective neuromuscular monitors
Routine reversal of the residual effects of nondepolarizing blockers is not standard of care in many departments of
anesthesia. Reversal agents are not without their own
potential side effects. Although early concerns about lethal
catastrophes after anticholinesterase administration were
clearly alarmist [60,61], it is also true that atropine,
glycopyrrolate, neostigmine, and edrophonium all have
potentially unwanted cardiovascular effects. In addition,
there is a perception among many clinicians that neostigmine increases the risk of postoperative nausea and
vomiting [62], although this assertion is highly doubtful
[63]. Finally, neostigmine may actually enhance TOF fade if
given to the patient who has fully recovered spontaneously
[64,65]. Thus, if satisfactory spontaneous recovery of
neuromuscular function has occurred, there are cogent
reasons to avoid administering unnecessary antagonists.
Unfortunately, many clinicians believe that 90 minutes after
an “intubating dose” (2•ED95) of rocuronium or vecuronium that reversal is not indicated. This is not necessarily
the case. Caldwell [65] found that 4 of 20 patients given
vecuronium, 0.10 mg/kg, had TOF ratios less than 0.75 after
2 hours of spontaneous recovery. Similarly, Debaene [37] in
a study of more than 500 patients given various blockers of
intermediate duration reported that 10% had a TOF ratio
less than 0.70 at 2 hours and in 30% of individuals the value
was less than 0.90. Probably in none of these individuals
would palpable or visual TOF fade be detectable. Thus, it is
hard to argue with the dictum of Viby-Mogensen [2] that
residual neuromuscular block should always be reversed
unless there is objective evidence that the TOF ratio has
recovered to acceptable levels.

Neuromuscular monitoring
Objective monitoring is also strongly indicated when
reversing profound neuromuscular block. If the TOF count is
at most 2, prompt recovery of neuromuscular function cannot
be assured by anticholinesterase administration. Nevertheless, neostigmine antagonism of deep block may result
in the rapid return of all 4 evoked responses to TOF
stimulation with minimal or no subjectively detectable fade
(a TOF ratio N0.40). Thus, a prolonged period may exist
where the TOF ratio is above 0.40 but below satisfactory
recovery levels [56]. Unless the clinician is aware of this
possibility, tracheal extubation may be undertaken when it is
clearly inappropriate [66].
Finally, there is at least some evidence that objective
monitoring does decrease the incidence of PORC. Gatke et al
[67] studied 120 adult patients randomized to two 60-patient
groups, one monitored acceleromyographically (AMG) and
the other monitored using only clinical criteria without a
nerve stimulator. Postoperatively, the TOF ratio was
measured with mechanomyography; a TOF ratio of less
than 0.80 indicated residual muscle paralysis. At the time of
tracheal extubation, residual muscle paralysis was found in
10 patients (17%) in the group without neuromuscular
monitoring and in only 2 patients (3%) in the AMG
monitored group. In the control group (no monitors), the
clinicians were very much aware of the goals of the study and
were trying to avoid residual weakness, their results (17%)
may represent a “best case scenario.” The authors concluded
that clinical evaluation of neuromuscular function does not
rule out significant residual paralysis after the intermediateacting muscle relaxant rocuronium, and the problem of
residual block can be minimized using acceleromyography.
Mortensen et al [68] in a similar study of 40 patients reported
that the number of patients with a TOF ratio less than 0.7 at
the time of extubation in the monitored group was
significantly fewer compared to those in the nonmonitored
group (1/19 patients vs 11/21 patients, respectively).
Perhaps the most convincing evidence that the use of
objective neuromuscular monitors (combined with a strong
educational effort at the departmental level) can decrease the
incidence of PORC comes from 2 studies by Baillard et al
[39]. The first was a prospective study of the incidence of
PORC after the administration of vecuronium in 568
consecutive patients for a 3-month period in 1995. As was
customary in the authors' department, no anticholinesterase
antagonists were given, and PNS devices were rarely used
(b2.0%) intraoperatively. Postoperative residual curarization
(indicated by an acceleromyographic TOF ratio of b0.70) in
the PACU was found in 42% of patients. Of 435 patients who
had been extubated in the operating room, the incidence of
PORC was 33%. As a result of these rather alarming
findings, Baillard's department placed acceleromyographic
monitors in all operating rooms shortly after the completion
of their 1995 study. In addition, the department instituted an
educational program about the use of neuromuscular
monitoring and the indications for neostigmine administration. The results of their findings regarding the incidence of

17
PORC were distributed to their staff. They then conducted
repeat 3-month surveys of clinical practice in the years 2000
(n = 130), 2002 (n = 101), and 2004 (n = 218) to determine
the success of their educational efforts [69]. In the 9-year
interval between these studies, the use of intraoperative
monitoring of neuromuscular function rose from 2% to 60%
and reversal of residual antagonism increased from 6% to
42% of cases. As a result of these changes in clinical practice,
the incidence of PORC (acceleromyographic TOF ratio of
b0.90) in Baillard's department decreased from 62% to less
than 4%. Baillard's results clearly show that when
nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs are administered by knowledgeable clinicians who use objective
neuromuscular monitors as adjuncts to their care and
administer anticholinesterase antagonists on indication that
the incidence of PORC can be reduced to very low levels.
A recent case by Claudius et al [70] is instructive. They
report an 84-year-old female with no special risk factors
given rocuronium, 0.60 mg/kg. At the end of surgery, 140
minutes later, the TOF count was zero (post tetanic count
[PTC] was 8). A decision was made to keep the patient
anesthetized until a second response to TOF stimuli could be
detected. This took an additional 75 minutes, at which time
neostigmine administration achieved prompt and satisfactory
antagonism (TOF N0.90). It is difficult to see how this case
could have been managed with intelligence in the absence of
neuromuscular monitoring. The authors correctly conclude:
“There are many myths and excuses for not using a nerve
stimulator. The truth, however, is that there are no good
reasons for not monitoring neuromuscular block whenever a
[nondepolarizing] neuromuscular blocking agent is given.”
Unfortunately, it is clear that large numbers of practitioners still fail to monitor neuromuscular function and to
administer antagonists when appropriate. Despite intense
educational campaigns, there will always be some clinicians
who fail to get the message. I have on several occasions
heard the comment “I haven't used a nerve stimulator in 30
years, and I see no reason to start now.” To that my usual
response is, “it is possible to make the same mistake for 3
decades and call it experience.”

5. How may new developments alter this
discussion? The future of neuromuscular
monitoring
It is clear that reversal of competitive neuromuscular
block by cholinesterase inhibitors has its limitations. Once
inhibition of true acetylcholinesterase is complete, giving
additional neostigmine does not serve any useful purpose. If
concentrations of blocking drug at the neuromuscular
nicotinic receptors are high enough, recovery will be
incomplete. Future progress in achieving rapid return of
neuromuscular function will probably result from some form
of “chemical reversal” of residual block. Binding of free drug

molecules in plasma such as the encapsulation of rocuronium
by sugammadex is one such example [71,72]. Another
approach is exemplified by the rapid inactivation of
gantacurium via cysteine adduction [73].
Initial published results of reversal of rocuroniuminduced block by sugammadex are very exciting. To give
just one example, after a 1.2-mg/kg dose of rocuronium, de
Boer et al reported that the median time for spontaneous
recovery to a TOF ratio of 0.90 was 126 minutes (range, 97139; n = 4). By contrast, if sugammadex, 12 mg/kg, was
given 5 minutes after the rocuronium bolus, recovery time
was reduced to 1.3 minutes (range, 1.0-1.9; n = 7).
Reversal of this level of profound block is simply not
possible with anticholinesterase inhibitors. Does this mean
we can finally throw away our nerve stimulators? I think
not. First of all, inadequate doses of sugammadex will
result in delayed recovery. In the study of de Boer [74],
when the dose of sugammadex was reduced to 2 mg/kg,
recovery to a TOF ratio of 0.90 still took an average of 56
minutes. This latter dose, however, is likely to be the
recommended amount when the TOF count has recovered
to 2 detectable responses at the adductor pollicis [75]. If the
posttetanic count is still only 1 to 2 then 4 mg/kg should be
administered. Thus, intelligent administration of sugammadex necessitates some knowledge of the extent of
neuromuscular block. Why not just give everyone 4 or
even 12 mg/kg of sugammadex and then throw away our
PNS units? First, until the drug has been given to tens of
thousands of patients, its potential for producing adverse
effects remains uncertain. In the interim, the fewer drugs
administered the better. Second, the acquisition price of the
sugammadex remains unknown, it appears that it will be
marketed in 200 and 500 mg vials. Somehow, I suspect that
routine administration of the later dose to a 70-kg
individual (7 mg/kg) will prove to be economically
unattractive. Finally, sugammadex administration may not
be appropriate for all patients. It probably should be
avoided in individuals with severe renal impairment, its
effects in women taking hormonal contraceptives are still
unclear, and it has no place in the antagonism of
nonsteroidal blockers.
Thus where do we stand? I think a strong case can be
made that when sugammadex is used to reverse rocuroniuminduced or vecuronium-induced block that convention PNS
units are adequate for safe and intelligent patient management. A knowledge of the PTC or TOF count is all that is
required for selection of a dose of sugammadex that will
promptly and reliably assure satisfactory neuromuscular
recovery. When anticholinesterase antagonists are used for
reversal of residual block the situation is more complicated.
Although it is hard to argue against the virtues of objective
monitors such as the TOF-Watch, I am not convinced that
their use is always necessary. If the adductor pollicis TOF
count has returned to 4 easily detected responses (with fade),
then neostigmine in doses of 0.05 to 0.07 mg/kg will
dependably achieve acceptable levels of recovery in at most

10 minutes. Four reasons outlined earlier in this chapter,
quantitative monitors are most valuable in 2 situations: (1)
when deciding whether to reverse neuromuscular block
when no fade on TOF stimulation can be detected or (2)
when evaluating the adequacy of reversal from profound
nondepolarizing block (TOF count ≤3).
A final thought. In 1969, I joined a private practice in a
nonteaching hospital on Long Island (NY). During my year
there, I used an electrocardiograph only once. We did not
have automated noninvasive blood pressure monitors, pulse
oximetry, capnography, anesthetic agent analyzers, or
cerebral function monitors. At the time, I did not feel that I
lacked any essential instrumentation. All of these technologies are now considered standard of care. Today objective
monitors of neuromuscular function can be purchased that
are relatively inexpensive, reliable, and easy to use. They
should be available in any modern anesthetizing location
where neuromuscular blocking drugs are administered.
