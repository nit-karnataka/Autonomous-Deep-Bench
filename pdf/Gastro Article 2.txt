Correlation of Quantitative HbsAg with Quantitative HBV
DNA in Different Phases of Chronic Hepatitis B (CHB)
Patients
Research Article

Abstract
Background: Quantitative HBsAg (qHBsAg) level is increasingly recognized as
an important marker in the course of HBV infection; however, its role in natural
history of disease is still unclear.

Aim: To study the baseline serum qHBsAg level and its association with
quantitative HBV DNA levels in different phases of Indian chronic hepatitis B
(CHB) patients.

Materials: We conducted cross-sectional study of consecutive 120 CHB patients
(mean age 37 [SD 13] years, 67% males). HBV DNA was measured by RT PCR and
serum qHBsAg levels by Abott Architect Assay.
Results: 90.8% were HBe-negative patients. Median serum qHBsAg of study
cohort was 3.74 log10 IU/mL. Overall correlation between qHBsAg levels and
HBV DNA levels was weak (spearmen r= 0.298) and also in HBe-negative patients
(r= 0.179). Patient having qHBsAg/HBV DNA ratio > 49.09 have shown good
correlation between qHBsAg levels and HBV DNA levels.
Conclusion: Quantitative HBsAg level was widely distributed among the different
phases of CHB. Serum qHBsAg may not replace serum HBV DNA test in majority
of adult CHB population which are mainly in HBe-negative low replicate stage.

Introduction

Hepatitis B continues to be a major health problem across the
world, especially in developing countries. As we know the test for
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was introduced more than 20
years ago, due to lack of appropriate standardisation HBsAg has
long been used as a qualitative marker for diagnosis of hepatitis
B [1]. Recently, an automated chemiluminescent micro particle
immunoassay for detection of HBsAg became available in India
and offered more reliable quantification of HBsAg [2]. Since HBsAg
levels correlate with intrahepatic covalently closed circular (CCC)
HBV DNA, the surrogate marker of the infected cell, it appears that
serum HBsAg levels may be a valuable addition to HBV DNA in
the management of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) [3,4].

New data on HBsAg quantification (qHBsAg) is emerging, and
it is becoming apparent that information on HBsAg levels can add
to our understanding of both the natural history of the disease
and its response to treatment. Recent studies have described
the clinical utility of HBsAg quantification [5-8]. Few studies
have compared quantitative HBsAg and HBV DNA during natural

history of the disease. Results of these are conflicting. Studies by
Kuhns et al. [9] and Mukherjee et al. [10] had shown no correlation
between qHBsAg and HBV DNA, while Ozdil et al. [11] reported
a negative correlation between two. There is paucity of data
regarding serum HBsAg levels in different phases of treatmentnaïve chronic hepatitis B.

The aim of our study was to learn more about the kinetics
of serum HBsAg levels and its correlation with HBV DNA levels
during the natural history of infection in Indian chronic hepatitis
B patients.

Materials and Methods

We studied all consecutive treatment-naïve adult HBsAgpositive subjects presented between July 2011 and July 2012
in the Gastroenterology department of tertiary-care hospital.
Patients with HIV or anti-HCV positivity, history of significant
alcohol intake (more than 20 g alcohol/day) or hepatotoxic drugs
within last 6 months prior to enrolment, history chronic liver
disease due to causes other than hepatitis B or undetectable HBV
DNA were excluded.
Demographic features and clinical presentations were noted
in a spreadsheet. All subjects underwent liver biochemistry
using a Beckman kit and auto-analyser (Beckman Coulter,
Inc, USA). Normal ALT was defined as up to 40 IU/L as per the
manufacturer’s recommendation; values more than 40 IU/L were

taken as elevated. Serological tests have done include HBeAg and
anti-HBe using the mini-VIDAS kit (BioMerieux, Inc, USA). Test for
HBV DNA was done using real-time polymerase chain reaction
(COBAS TaqMan; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA); the
lower limit of detection was 0.4 IU/mL. HBsAg quantification
(qHBsAg) was done by Abbott Architect assay (Dr. Lal PathlabsNational reference lab at New Delhi, India). All patients were
counselled and advised to have family members and household
contacts screened for HBsAg.

The chronic hepatitis B phase was determined for each patient
after evaluating liver function test over one year, HBe antigen
status and HBV DNA levels as: Immune tolerant (IT) phase,
defined as HBeAg positive, high viral load ( > 20000 IU/ml), serum
ALT <2X upper limit normal (ULN), Immune clearance (IC) phase,
defined as HBeAg positive, HBV DNA > 20000 IU/ml, serum ALT
>2 X ULN, Low replicative (LR) phase, defined as HBeAg negative,
HBV DNA <2000 IU/mL, normal serum ALT and HBeAg-negative
hepatitis (ENH) phase, defined as HBeAg negative, HBV DNA
>2000 IU/mL, serum ALT >2 X ULN. Correlation between HBV
DNA and quantitative HBsAg was studied within each phase.

Statistical methods

Numerical variables are represented in the form of mean as
well as median or inter-quartile range whenever applicable.
Table 1: Baseline characteristics in the four phases.

Qualitative data are represented by means of frequency and
percentage. Correlation was analysed using the non-parametric
two-tailed Spearman rank correlation test where variables are not
normally distributed. All p values less than 0.05 are considered
significant. Numerical data were calculated using Microsoft Excel
and analysed using SPSS version 16 software package (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).

Results

A total of 120 treatment-naïve HBsAg-positive patients (80
men, 66.6%; aged 25 to 49, mean 37) were evaluated during
the study period. Cirrhosis was present in 9 and hepatocellular
carcinoma was diagnosed in 2 (1.6%) patients on Imaging.
Ultrasonography findings were normal in 96 (80%) subjects.
During screening of family members, HBsAg positivity was found
in 24 (20%) subjects.

On serological testing, of the 120 HBsAg-positive subjects, 109
(90.8%) were HBe-negative and 11 (9.6%) were HBe-positive.
On further classifying into phases of chronic hepatitis B, 4 (3.3%)
subjects were in immune-tolerant phase, 7 (5.8%) in immunereactive phase, 96 (80%) in low-replicative phase, and 13 (10.8%)
had HBe-negative hepatitis. The male female ratio, mean age, and
the mean ALT values, median quantitative HBV DNA (IU/ml) and
median quantitative HBsAg (IU/ml) are shown in Table 1.

HBsAg in cirrhosis (n=9) patients was 3.41 log10 IU/ml (range
-0.1 to 26153 IU/ml). It was lower than median HBsAg of study
population, however it did not reached statistical significance
(p=0.72). Median HBsAg levels among subjects with family
history of hepatitis B (n=24) was 3.74 log10 IU/ml (range -89.67 to
125000 IU/ml) and was similar to median HBsAg of study group.

There was a modest negative correlation between age
and quantitative serum HBsAg levels (r = -0.39, p<0.05). The
correlation between ALT and HBsAg did not pass the test of
statistical significance (r= 0.045, p>0.05).

Overall correlation between serum quantitative HBsAg levels
and serum HBV DNA levels was weak, with correlation coefficient
0.29 (Figure 1). In HBe-negative patients, the correlation was
weak (r= 0.17), however the correlation was strong (r= 0.87)
among small number of HBe-positive subjects (Figure 2 & 3).

The ratio between HBV DNA and HBsAg ranged from 0.00051
to 62658.4 and the ratio increased exponentially over 49.09. We
took a cut-off ratio of 49.09 (87.5th percentile of total HBV DNAto-quantitative HBsAg ratio) to divide our cohort in to two groups.
This was similar to a Korean study by Lee et al. [12]. We observed

that the correlation between HBV DNA and HBsAg in the group
that showed HBV DNA-to-HBsAg ratio higher than 49.09 was
stronger (Spearman r=0.83, p<0.001, n=15) than those with ratio
at or below 49.09 (Spearman r= 0.28, p<0.001, n= 105). This
group mainly consist of HBe-positive subjects.

Discussion
Serum HBV DNA level is commonly used to monitor treatment
response in the management of chronic hepatitis B, but the test
is expensive [13,14]. The clinical impact of HBsAg quantification
has recently drawn attention. Standardised quantitative serum
HBsAg test is now available, and is relatively simple and less
expensive and can be performed in a fully automated manner.
Quantitative serum HBsAg correlates well with intrahepatic HBV
viral DNA [4,15].

We found the overall correlation between serum HBsAg and
HBV DNA weak. There was a tendency for better correlation
between HBsAg and HBV DNA in HBe-positive patients. This has
corroborated the findings of recent study in similar cohort by
Ramchandran et al. [16]. However, the number of HBe-positive
patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria was only eleven. The
correlation is weak in the low-replicative phase, which forms
the majority of our chronic hepatitis B study population. Similar
results were shown by Brunetto et al. [17] in their study of
HBe-negative genotype D patients. Although we did not test for
genotype, we expect that most samples would be of HBV genotype
D, because unpublished data from our hospital reported this
genotype as the most common. This suggests that quantitative
HBsAg is more related with HBV DNA levels in initial replicative
phase than in later non-replicative phases.
It is difficult to compare amongst phases of chronic hepatitis
B as numbers in Immune-tolerant and Immune-reactive phases
were small but it’s worth mentioning that median serum HBsAg
levels in our study were higher in the immune-tolerant and
immune-reactive phases and lower in the low-replicative and

e-negative hepatitis phase. Earlier similar results have been
reported in a study from Europe mainly involving genotypes A
and D1 and also in two Korean studies of genotype C [18,19]

In our study group if patients were divided in two groups by
HBV DNA-to-HBsAg ratio, with a cut-off value of 49.09 (87.5th
percentile), the correlation between quantitative HBsAg and HBV
DNA in patients having ratio>49.09 was stronger compared to
those having ratio less or equal to 49.09. This is also because Hbepositive subjects mainly had ratio >49.09.

The study has limitation that the number of HBe-positive
patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria was few. This has restricted
us from carrying any major presumptions from our HBe-positive
patient cohort. Since we enrolled consecutive adult subjects, it
explains the low rate of HBe positivity in our study group but also
mimics real time scenario.

Conclusion

In conclusion, quantitative serum HBsAg test is less likely to
replace serum HBV DNA test in the low replicative stage of chronic
hepatitis B which forms our majority of adult CHB population.
