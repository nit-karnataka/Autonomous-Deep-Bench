Objective(s): The purpose of our study was to evaluate whether the inﬂammatory parameters of complete blood count (CBC), including white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR),
platelet-to-lymphocyte-ratio (PLR), and mean platelet volume (MPV), had potential roles in the etiopathogenesis of unexplained infertility (UI) among nonobese women. We also aimed to investigate
whether there could be an association between these markers and in vitro fertilization (IVF) success
among nonobese women with UI.
Materials and methods: This was a retrospective clinical trial, including a total of 246 nonobese patients
undergoing IVF procedures, 121 diagnosed as UI and 125 were age and body mass index (BMI) matched
infertile controls who received IVF for tubal factor and male factor. Only normoweight (BMI<25 kg/m2)
participants were recruited to our study to rule out the effect of obesity on inﬂammation. CBC parameters
were evaluated before ovarian stimulation protocol.
Results: All of the inﬂammatory parameters of CBC were distributed homogenously between groups.
Platelet and lymphocyte count were positively correlated with fertilization rate (FR) among UI patients.
Embryo count was positively correlated with platelet and negatively correlated with MPV. PLR was also
positively correlated with luteinizing hormone on day 3 of cycle. After adjustment for age and BMI, there
was a positive association between lymphocyte count and FR and a negative association between PLR
and implantation among UI patients. None of the inﬂammatory markers of CBC were predictive for
clinical pregnancy, take home baby, and clinical and biochemical abortion rates among nonobese UI
patients.
Conclusion: Increased levels of CBC inﬂammation markers may have a negative impact on IVF outcomes
among nonobese women with UI.

Introduction
Unexplained infertility (UI) refers to the condition of infertility
in which the results of standard investigations, including ovulation
tests (midluteal serum progesteron level), tubal and uterine
patency (hysterosalpingogram), and semen analysis (spermiogram), are all normal [1]. The prevalence of UI ranges from 15 to
25% among infertile couples after their diagnostic procedures [2].
Although the etiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying UI are unclear, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as abnormalities related to oocyte, tubal, or sperm function, which cannot
be diagnosed by standard diagnostic procedures [3e5].

In vitro fertilization (IVF) is an effective and successful therapeutic option for UI patients when other infertility treatments have
failed to achieve a pregnancy. Moreover, IVF may provide additional
diagnostic information regarding gamete function [6]. However,
studies have shown lower success rates of IVF in women with UI
than in other infertile women [6]. Higher failure rates of IVF in UI
couples suggest that there may be other key factors which play
essential roles in the absence of known infertility.
Low-grade chronic inﬂammation is deﬁned as an elevation of
several inﬂammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP),
tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), and interleukins (IL) [7e10]. Lowgrade chronic inﬂammation is commonly blamed for the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of infertility due to the altered levels of inﬂammatory markers in unexplained infertile patients [11,12]. Studies
have demonstrated an association between IL and proinﬂammatory

factors and higher failure rates of IVF, especially in the implantation
stage, among UI women [13]. Some complete blood count (CBC)
parameters, such as white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil, and
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), are thought to be inﬂammatory markers [14e17]. In recent years, the platelet-to-lymphocyte
ratio (PLR) and mean platelet volume (MPV) are also increasingly
used as markers of chronic inﬂammation [17e19]. It has been found
that PLR could serve as a biological marker of both thrombosis and
inﬂammation [20]. It is believed that increased proliferation of
platelets is the result of an ongoing proinﬂammatory state [20]. MPV
is also a marker of platelet activation because there is a close relationship between platelet size and platelet activation [20].
Although it has been documented that infertility involves
chronic inﬂammation, it remains to be seen whether an increased
inﬂammatory response affects IVF success rates. There are some
reports about NLR, MPV, and PLR in infertile women with PCOS
[20]; however, there is no report regarding CBC parameters in
women with UI. Concerning the possible role of inﬂammation in
infertility and IVF success, we aimed to investigate whether CBC
inﬂammation markers are one of the etiopathogenetic mechanisms
of UI and whether there is an association between these markers
and IVF success among women with UI.
Material-method
This was a retrospective case control study performed in the IVF
Unit of Suleyman Demirel University Faculty of Medicine, between
January 2012 and December 2016. The study was approved by the
Local Ethics Committee with the protocol number 72867572- 0505026. Data were collected from the hospital ﬁles of infertile women
who administered to our clinic for an IVF cycle.
Patients selection
We scanned all the ﬁles of patients undergoing IVF treatment. A
total of 246 infertile patients were randomly selected for the study.
The unexplained group was comprised of 121 women, and the control group was comprised of 125 infertile women, who were
matched by age and body mass index (BMI). All the women in the
sample were between the ages of 21 and 44 years old. Only normoweight (BMI<25 kg/m2) participants were recruited to our study
to rule out the effect of obesity on inﬂammation. All participants
had normal ovarian morphology, demonstrated normal ultrasonographic examinations, and had regular ovulatory cycles.
Patients were diagnosed with UI after being evaluated based on
standard infertility tests, according to the guidelines of the Practice
Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine [2].
These tests included assessments of spermiogram, ovulation, hysterosalpingogram, and, if indicated, ovarian reserve tests and laparoscopy. If the results of all these tests were normal, patients were
accepted as UI. The inclusion criteria for the study group were a
minimum of one-year infertility duration, a regular menstrual cycle
of 21e35 days, evidence of ovulation (midluteal serum progesterone (PG) level >5 ng/ml), levels of the day 2 follicle stimulating
hormone (FSH) being <10 IU/L, normal tubal patency conﬁrmed
with hysterosalpingogram, and normal sperm parameters (sperm
density >15 million/mL; progressive motility >40%; and normal
forms >4%; or total progressive motile sperm count >5 million
according to World Health Organization criteria) [21].
The control group included women who underwent IVF for male
or tubal factor related infertility. However, patients with hydrosalpinx, severe pelvic adhesions, endometriosis or pelvic inﬂammatory disease, severe male factor (azoospermia and severe
oligoasthenospermia), and diminished ovarian reserve were not
included as controls.

Exclusion criteria for all participants were systemic diseases
(hypertension, diabetes, asthma, liver/kidney disease, etc), endocrinological
abnormalities
(hyper/hypothyroidism,
hyperprolactinemia, etc), evidence of postmenopausal FSH levels, ovarian
disease (endometrioma, etc), hematologic disorders (haemophilia,
etc), malignancy, presence of infectious disease, autoimmune diseases, history of splenectomy, use of anti-inﬂammatory drugs or
glucocorticoids, and other chronic inﬂammatory conditions
(arthritis, etc). Patients who had a BMI of >25 kg/m2 and demonstrated smoking and alcohol use were also excluded.
Data collection
We recorded the demographic features of patients, including
age; partner's age; BMI; cycle count (if performed); duration of
infertility; and day 3 basal hormone levels, including FSH, LH, and
estradiol (E2) levels. Moreover, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
and prolactin (PRL) levels that had been measured on a random day
were recorded from the patients' ﬁles.
Stimulation protocol (agonist/antagonist), type of gonadotropin
(recombinant/urinary), type of human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG) (recombinant/urinary), and starting dose of gonadotropin
were also recorded from the patients' ﬁles.
Oocyte retrieval parameters, including the number of total
retrieved oocytes, methaphase II (MII), MI, germinal vesicle (GV),
oocytes with anomaly, and oocytes with empty zona (EZ), were
noted from embryologic data. “An oocyte with anomaly” was
deﬁned on the basis of cytoplasmic (such as presence of abnormal
cytoplasmic granulation, dark cytoplasm, vacuolization, inclusion
body, refractile body and smooth endoplasmic reticulum) and
extracytoplasmic (such as differences in size, anomaly in shape,
thickness of zona pellucida, wideness of perivitelline space, presence of debris in perivitelline space, fragmented polar body) features of an oocyte. Fertilization (deﬁned as the presence of two
pronuclei one day after intracytoplasmic sperm injection), embryo
number, and embryo quality were also recorded. In our IVF unit, the
quality of embryos was evaluated on day 3 when the embryos were
at least at the 8-cell stage, according to their morphological characteristics. The embryos were classiﬁed from Grade 1 (best quality)
to Grade 3 (poor quality). Embryos with even-sized blastomeres
and/or <5% fragments were classiﬁed as Grade 1; embryos with
slightly-moderate size differences in blastomeres and/or 5e50%
fragments were classiﬁed as Grade 2 (moderate quality); and embryos with markedly different-sized blastomeres and/or >50%
fragments were classiﬁed as Grade 3.
We calculated the fertilization rate (FR) as the ratio of fertilized
oocytes to MII oocytes. The results were classiﬁed as ‘low FR’ and
‘normal FR’, if the FR was <60% and 60%, respectively.
IVF outcomes, including implantation, clinical pregnancy (CP),
take-home baby, biochemical abortion (BA), and clinical abortion
(CA), were noted from the patient's ﬁle. Implantation was determined as positive hCG 14 days following embryo transfer. CP was
established as the identiﬁcation of an intrauterine gestational sac
via transvaginal ultrasonographic examination. The take-home baby
rate was determined by identifying whether the patients delivered
or not. BA referred to a pregnancy that was diagnosed only by the
detection of hCG in serum or urine and that did not develop into a
clinical pregnancy. CA was deﬁned as the disappearance of an
initially proven gestational sac according to a transvaginal
ultrasound.
Laboratory evaluation
We also scanned the CBC parameters of all the patients in the
sample. In our IVF unit, we routinely scanned the CBC of all the

patients before conducting the controlled ovarian stimulation
protocol to determine whether the patients had any disorder or not
and to prepare for the administration of anaesthesia. Venous blood
samples were taken into the ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid
(EDTA) possesing tubes between 08: 00 and 09: 00 AM, after an
overnight 12 h fasting. The CBC was performed using an auto blood
analyser (Cell-Dyn 3700.Abbott®, USA). WBC, neutrophil,
lymphocyte, platelet, MPV levels and NLR and PLR were recorded.
Statistical analysis
The Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows (SPSS 20,
Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses. A p value < 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant. The distribution of data
were evaluated by KolmogroweSmirnow test. Student's t-test or
Mann Whitney U test and Chi-square or Fischer's exact test were
used for comparisons. Data were expressed as mean ± SD. Correlations between continous variables were evaluated using Pearson's correlation analysis or Spearman's rank test. Logistic
regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between
dependent and independent variables.
Results
A total of 246 nonobese infertile patients were recruited to
our study. The unexplained group was comprised of 121 women
diagnosed as UI, and the control group was comprised of 125
BMI-matched controls. Only the normoweight (BMI<25 kg/m2)
participants were recruited to rule out the effect of obesity on
inﬂammation.

Oocyte retrieval parameters and IVF outcome between unexplained
and control group
Gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonists were used for
down-regulation of the pituitary gland in all the patients. Most of
the patients were stimulated by both the recombinant and the
urinary FSH. There were no signiﬁcant differences in terms of the
starting dose and type of gonadotropin used for each of the groups.
Recombinant hCG was used in all the patients for ﬁnal maturation
of oocytes. Single fresh embryo transfer was performed in all patients according to the rules of Turkish reproduction. All the oocyte
retrieval parameters except the number of oocytes with anomaly
were distributed homogenously between the unexplained and
control groups. The UI group had a higher number of oocytes with
anomaly (0.13 ± 0.53) than the control group had (0.08 ± 0.38,
p ¼ 0.04). Among the 246 initiated cycles, ﬁve cycles had no oocytes
retrieved, and only three cases had immature oocytes for which
ICSI could not be performed; therefore, fertilization was assessed
among the remaining 238 cycles. Total fertilization failure occurred
in 16 cases (13.2%) in the UI group and in 11 cases (8.8%) in the
control group. Embryo transfer could be performed in 99 cases of
the UI group and 93 cases of the control group. MII rate, FR, embryo
number, and embryo quality were distributed homogenously between the two groups (p ¼ 0.88, p ¼ 0.15, p ¼ 0.38, and p ¼ 0.5,
respectively).
Implantation was 14.1% in the UI group and 21.5% in the control
group (p ¼ 0.18). Although implantation, CP, and take-home baby
rates were all lower in the unexplained group than in the control
group, this difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. BA and CA
rates were also comparable between the UI and control groups
(Table 2).

Baseline characteristics
The mean age of the UI group was 30.09 ± 4.59, and the mean
age of the control group was 29.72 ± 5.09. The BMI of the unexplained group was 23.58 ± 3.37 kg/m2, and the BMI of the control
group was 23.16 ± 2.81 kg/m2. As shown in Table 1, there were no
signiﬁcant differences in age range and BMI (p ¼ 0.54 and p ¼ 0.28,
respectively) between the two groups. Partner's age, duration of
infertility, and cycle count were distributed homogenously between the unexplained and control groups (p ¼ 0.052, p ¼ 0.14, and
p ¼ 0.58, respectively). Day 3 basal hormone levels, TSH levels, and
PRL levels were also similar between the two groups. A comparison
of the baseline characteristics between the unexplained and control
groups is presented in Table 1.

Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association
between the CBC inﬂammation markers and FR, implantation, CP,
take home baby rate, BA, and CA in the unexplained group. Age,
BMI, WBC, platelet, neutrophil, lymphocyte, NLR, PLR, and MPV
were the independent variables to analyse the dependent variables.
Lymphocyte was the only positive predictive marker [p ¼ 0.01;
b ¼ 0.99, OR (95% CI) ¼ 2.69 (1.24e5.84)] for normal FR in the
unexplained group. Related data is shown in Table 5. For implantation, PLR was the only negative predictive marker [p ¼ 0.047,
b ¼ 0.016, OR (95% CI) ¼ 0.98 (0.96e1)] in the unexplained group.
There was no predictive effect of investigated parameters on CP,
take home baby rate, BA, and CA.
Discussion

Correlation between the inﬂammatory parameters of CBC and basal
hormone levels and IVF outcomes among unexplained group
There was no correlation between age, BMI, and inﬂammatory
markers in the UI group. There was also no correlation between the
CBC inﬂammation markers and the FSH and E2 levels in the UI
group. However, LH levels were positively correlated with PLR
(r ¼ 0.22, p ¼ 0.01). In terms of IVF outcomes, we found a positive
correlation between FR and platelet (r ¼ 0.27, p ¼ 0.003) as well as
between FR and lymphocyte (r ¼ 0.23, p ¼ 0.01). Embryo number
was positively correlated with platelet (r ¼ 0.22, p ¼ 0.01) and
negatively correlated with MPV (r ¼ 0.18, p ¼ 0.04). The correlation CBC inﬂammation markers with basal hormone levels and
IVF outcome among UI women is shown in Table 4.

In this study, we investigated CBC inﬂammation markers,
including WBC, neutrophil, lymphocyte, NLR, PLR, and MPV in
nonobese UI women undergoing IVF treatment compared to age
and BMI-matched controls and also investigated the relationship
between these markers and IVF outcomes among women with UI.
Adipose tissue can secrete hormones, adipokines, and cytokines
[22], and studies have shown that inﬂammation can caused by
obesity. Therefore, to exclude the impact of obesity on inﬂammation, only the participants with a BMI of <25 kg/m2 were recruited
to our study.
There was no difference between the unexplained and control
groups in terms of CBC inﬂammation markers, including WBC,
platelet, neutrophil, lymphocyte, NLR, PLR, and MPV. Growing evidence supports that infertility is associated with low-grade chronic

inﬂammation. Evaluating NLR and PLR could predict systemic
inﬂammation [23]. Consistent with our study, studies have found
no differences between UI and fertile controls in terms of WBC and
lymphocytes in the assessment of plasma between days 20 and 24
of the menstrual cycle [24]. Studies have found elevated interferong (IFN-g) and IL-2 levels and decreased transforming growth factorb (TGF-b, an important endogenous anti-inﬂammatory mediator)
[11] in the plasma of UI patients compared to fertile controls during
the implantation window (luteal phase) [24]. Moreover, UI patients
have demonstrated elevated serum IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-21, TNF-a, and
IFN-g levels compared to fertile individuals [12]. In this study, the
small sample size and other factors which affect CBC parameters,
such as subclinical infections, could be the causes of the nonsigniﬁcant differences between the unexplained and control groups.
Moreover, in contrast to previous studies, all the participants in our
study were nonobese; therefore, the results of the current study
could have been affected by the participants’ BMI.
We found decreased implantation, clinical pregnancy, and takehome baby rates in the UI group; however, the differences in these
measures were not statistically signiﬁcant between the two groups.
Consistent with our study, studies have shown lower success rates
with IVF in UI patients compared in other infertile women [6].
There was no correlation between the CBC inﬂammation
markers and FSH and E2 levels; however, LH levels were positively
correlated with PLR among women with UI. We also found a positive correlation between platelet and embryo number as well as a
positive correlation between platelet and FR. Lymphocyte count
was also positively correlated with FR, and MPV was negatively
correlated with embryo number. A previous report found no relationship between CBC inﬂammation markers and FSH and E2 levels;
however, it has been demonstrated that LH levels were negatively
correlated with neutrophil and lymphocyte count and positively
correlated with PLR in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS) [20]. A discrepancy in the study groups could be one cause
of the dissimilarity in the results.
Lymphocyte was found to be the only positive predictive
marker for normal FR in the unexplained group, and PLR was the
only negative predictive marker for implantation in the unexplained group after adjusting for age and BMI. The positive predictive ability of lymphocyte regarding FR, and the negative
predictive ability of PLR regarding implantation among UI patients
suggests that inﬂammation could negatively affect IVF outcomes in
UI patients. There are a few studies that concern the role of CBC
parameters on IVF outcomes. MPV values were reported to be
negatively correlated with CP and implantation rate, and PLR levels
were found to be positively associated with miscarriages in patients with PCOS [20]. It is believed that one of primary mechanisms of implantation failure and abortion in UI is the
compromised receptivity of the endometrium, and studies have
highlighted the role of immune factors in implantation failure in UI
women [25]. It has been suggested that elevated platelet counts
and PLR, and decreased lymphocyte counts are risk indicators of
both thrombosis and inﬂammation [17,20]. It is believed that
increased proliferation of platelets is the result of an ongoing
proinﬂammatory state [20]. Both thrombosis and inﬂammation via
demonstrated PLR could affect implantation negatively. Inﬂammation is the key feature of endothelial dysfunction [14]. Endotelial
dysfunction and elevated PLR could contribute to increased hemostatic functions resulting in thrombosis of spiral arterioles
[19,26]. It has also been suggested that platelet activation plays a
central role in the etiopathogenesis of arterial occlusion and could
also cause injury to the endothelium resulting in elevated thromboxane A2 levels [20]. Therefore, a negative association between
PLR and embryo implantation can be explained by thrombosis of
spiral arterioles.

The main limitation of our study is its small sample size and lack
of power calculation. Another limitation its retrospective design
and its use of data from a single tertiary centre. This limits the
ability of the results to reﬂect and apply to the general population.
The lack of evaluation of oocyte quality, which is closely associated
with fertilization, was another limitation. It should be noted that
our study group was only infertile women undergoing IVF treatment, and the results could not be generalized to all UI patients
experiencing spontaneous cycles or taking ovulation induction
drugs without undergoing IVF. Moreover, IVF is a supraphysiologic
situation in which many other factors, such as laboratory conditions, could affect its success. Despite these limitations, this was the
ﬁrst study that evaluated the association between CBC inﬂammation markers and IVF outcome in women with UI.
Conclusion
In conclusion, our data suggest that inﬂammation may have a
negative impact on IVF outcomes among women with UI. Future
prospective studies with the larger population are needed to
elucidate the impact of inﬂammation on IVF success among UI
patients.
