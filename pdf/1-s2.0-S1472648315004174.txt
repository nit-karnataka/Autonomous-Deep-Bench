recurrent miscarriage and recurrent implantation failure.

Limited information is available on the balance state of pro- and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines in patients with recurrent
implantation failure (RIF). This study assessed the pro- and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines in plasma of 34 patients with RIF, compared
with those of 25 women with a successful pregnancy in the ﬁrst IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer (IVF/ICSI–ET)
cycle. The IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-4 concentrations were higher, whereas the TGF-β1 concentration was lower in the RIF group compared with the control group. Furthermore, the ratios of pro-inﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines IFN-γ/IL-4, IFN-γ/IL-10,
IFN-γ/TGF-β1, IL-6/IL-10, IL-6/TGF-β1, IL-1β/TGF-β1 and TNF-α/TGF-β1 were higher in the RIF group (all P < 0.01). The results suggested a shift toward a pro-inﬂammatory state in peripheral blood of the patients with RIF.

Introduction
With the improvements in ovarian stimulation protocols and
laboratory culture conditions, IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm
injection–embryo transfer (IVF/ICSI–ET) has evolved greatly
since the ﬁrst successful pregnancy. However, recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is still a challenging step for IVF/ICSI–
ET. The aetiology of RIF mainly includes three categories:
decreased endometrial receptivity, embryonic defects and
other combined effects (Margalioth et al., 2006).
The immunological causes, especially the cytokine network,
may be one of the most important factors that inﬂuence endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation (Orsi and Tribe,
2008). Cytokines are divided into pro-inﬂammatory and antiinﬂammatory cytokines according to their functions. The proinﬂammatory cytokines include Th1-type cytokines (such as
IFN-γ and TNF-α) and other cytokines (such as IL-1β and
IL-6), whereas the anti-inﬂammatory cytokines are Th2type cytokines (such as IL-4 and IL-10) and other cytokines
(such as TGF-β1). Cumulative evidence indicates that the proand anti-inﬂammatory cytokines form an intricate signalling
network and that the physiological balance between them is
critical for embryo implantation and pregnancy maintenance (Wilczynski, 2005).
The intracellular Th1 cytokine polarization of the T helper
cell in peripheral blood was present in patients with RIF
(Kwak-Kim et al., 2003); nevertheless, a series of pro- and
anti-inﬂammatory cytokines in plasma and their balance state
in RIF patients have not been sufﬁciently studied. Although
cytokines are produced mainly by T helper cell subsets, the
antigen-presenting cell and other immune cells can also participate in cytokine secretion. Therefore, the cytokine in
plasma can probably better reﬂect the whole immunological status in peripheral blood. Moreover, in terms of the cooperative and antagonistic action between pro-inﬂammatory
and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines, it is unlikely that the defect
of one single cytokine in the network would affect the overall
balance status of the systemic immunity.
This prospective study assessed the pro-inﬂammatory and
anti-inﬂammatory cytokine proﬁle in plasma of the RIF patients in the mid-luteal phase, i.e. the implantation window,
compared with that of successful pregnancy women in the ﬁrst
IVF/ICSI–ET cycle at the same point prior to IVF/ICSI–ET treatment, aiming to evaluate the balance status of proinﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines in the
peripheral blood of the RIF patients.

Materials and methods
The study was performed at the Fertility Centre, Shenzhen
Zhongshan Urology Hospital and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Zhongshan Urology Hospital on 28 February 2013 (reference no. SZZSRPHU201300012). The informed consent was obtained from each
patient before the study.
The inclusion criteria of the RIF group include: (i) failure
to achieve a pregnancy following two to six IVF/ICSI–ET cycles,
in which more than 10 high-grade embryos were transferred; (ii) ≤ 38 years old; and (iii) basal FSH < 10 mIU/ml.
The inclusion criteria of the control group include: (i)
became pregnant following fresh ET in the ﬁrst IVF/ICSI–ET

P-Y Liang et al.
cycle; (ii) ≤38 years old; (iii) basal FSH < 10 mIU/ml and antral
follicle counts in both ovaries ≥8; and (iv) the ovarian stimulation protocol was a standard long protocol.
The exclusion criteria of all subjects include: (i) uterine
abnormality; (ii) a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),
spontaneous abortions and autoimmune diseases; (iii) abnormal chromosome karyotype of either wife or husband; and
(iv) the white cell count and C-reactive protein were abnormal on the blood sampling day.
In total 34 women were enrolled in the RIF group and 25
women were enrolled in the control group. All the blood samples
were drawn in the mid-luteal phase, the very speciﬁc time of
uterine receptivity, prior to IVF/ICSI–ET treatment. This can
also minimize the effects of ovarian stimulation drugs on the
cytokines. Whole blood samples (5 ml) were drawn in venous
blood collection tubes with anticoagulant from the midluteal phase. The whole blood samples were incubated with
25 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 1 mmol/l
ionomycin (Sigma, USA) for 4 h. After culture, the supernatant was drawn and centrifuged at 2500g for 20 min at 4°C to
obtain the plasma samples. Aliquots were stored at 70°C until
use by ﬂow cytometry measurements. The pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β, anti-inﬂammatory
cytokines IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-β1 in plasma were detected using
BD Cytometric Bead Array (CBA) (BD Biosciences Pharmingen,
USA). The CBA immunoassay was carried out according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The latent TGF-β1 was measured in the immunoreactive form using a single-plex assay,
while other cytokines were measured in a multiplex assay.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences version 18 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
The data were shown as mean ± standard error. Unpaired
t-tests were applied for comparisons of cytokine expression
in plasma and pro-inﬂammatory/anti-inﬂammatory cytokine
ratios between the RIF and control groups (P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant).

Results
The mean age of the RIF group was 34.35 ± 2.53 (range: 31–
38) years, and the mean age of the control group was 33.12
± 2.29 (range: 29–38) years. No signiﬁcant differences were
observed in the age, basal sex hormones and body mass index
(BMI) between the control and RIF groups (data not shown).

cytokines IL-4 (58.55 ± 5.97 versus 29.43 ± 4.19, P < 0.001)
were signiﬁcantly higher in the RIF group compared with the

were signiﬁcantly higher in the RIF group compared with the

Discussion
A wide and evolving literature exists on the Th-1/Th-2 equilibrium in pregnancy. Although a certain local proinﬂammatory environment is necessary for embryo
implantation and angiogenesis (Mor et al., 2011), the dominant Th-1 cytokine or pro-inﬂammatory cytokine is seen to
be harmful in pregnancy and the Th-2 or anti-inﬂammatory
cytokine regulates and ameliorates the Th-1 response (Saito
et al., 2010). The data from this study show that a proinﬂammatory state was presented in RIF patients: increased
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1β and IL-6, decreased
anti-inﬂammatory cytokine TGF-β1 and raised proinﬂammatory/anti-inﬂammatory cytokine ratios. The disturbance of the pro- and anti-inﬂammatory cytokine balance in
peripheral blood was probably associated with the RIF.
The ﬁndings are in line with the several published studies
that have shown Th-1 cytokine or pro-inﬂammatory cytokine

polarization of T helper intracellular cytokines in RIF patients (Kalu et al., 2008; Kwak-Kim et al., 2003). A previous
study also demonstrated the increased ratios of Th-1/Th-2 in
the IVF/ICSI−ET failure patients (Liang et al., 2015). However,
due to the method restriction, the number of intracellular
cytokines of T helper cells that can be detected simultaneously was limited, and the results were presented in percentages. In contrast, a variety of cytokines in plasma can be
measured and analysed quantitatively using the Cytometric
Bead Array in this study, as this is an accurate and precise
method to measure cytokines in plasma. From the literature, it has been seen that not only do the T cells play an important role in pregnancy, but the innate immune cells are
also essential for embryo implantation and angiogenesis (Lee
et al., 2011). The maternal immune tolerance is likely to be
modulated by both adaptive and innate immunity during pregnancy. The natural killer cells − macrophage, dendritic cell
and Treg cell − migrate and increase in the endometrium
during the implantation window. Deletion of these cells has
deleterious effects on implantation and placental development (Hanna et al., 2006; Sargent et al., 2006). Previous
studies have shown that the circulating and local immune cells
communicate with each other, and the systematic immune
state may inﬂuence local immune cell mobilization and activation (Fujiwara, 2009). Therefore, it is indeed very important that the whole cytokine contents in peripheral blood
be analysed at the putative time of embryo implantation.
The lower concentration of TGF-β1 in the RIF group was
another result consistent with the imbalance of proinﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines. Recent studies
have reported that TGF-β1 is an essential immune-regulatory

and anti-inﬂammatory cytokine during embryo implantation
and it is also implicated in the generation and differentiation of Treg cells, which play a vital role in immune tolerance in pregnancy (Guerin et al., 2009). A previous study
reported that the Treg cell decreased in peripheral blood of
RIF patients (Chen et al., 2009). It is hypothesized that decreased expression of TGF-β1 could be a contributing factor
to the elevated pro-inﬂammatory cytokines and the decrease of Treg cells, which could be detrimental to embryo
implantation.
Although the concentration of anti-inﬂammatory cytokine
IL-4 in the RIF group was increased, which maybe a regulated expression of the higher pro-inﬂammatory cytokine polarization, the ratio of IFN-γ/IL-4 in the RIF group was still twofold higher than those of the control group. This indicated that
the IL-4 increase in concentration probably did not change
the status of pro-inﬂammatory cytokine polarization in the
RIF group. These results are in line with the previously published literature on patients with demyelinating diseases
(Hohnoki et al., 1998).
Although the mechanism of pro-inﬂammatory polarization is unknown, it may affect embryo implantation through
a number of mechanisms. Firstly, excess pro-inﬂammatory
cytokine (especially IFN-γ) could activate macrophage and
induce its differentiation, which may express nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and mediate directly the damage to trophoblasts (Haddad et al., 1997). Secondly, it was reported that
both extravillous trophoblast proliferation and invasion were
inhibited in vitro by the combined pro-inﬂammatory cytokines
(Otun et al., 2011). Therefore, the dominance of proinﬂammatory cytokines was probably one of the important
factors affecting embryo implantation.
Although the results suggested that a pro-inﬂammatory
state was present in RIF patients, it should be noted that
whether the circulating immunological status in the peripheral blood could reﬂect the cytokine status at the local site
in the uterus during embryo implantation was not determined in the present study. As it is extremely difﬁcult to study
embryo implantation in vivo in women, the evaluation of immunological status in the peripheral blood may be a feasible way to investigate the immunological cause of RIF and
can easily be put into application.
In conclusion, the results from this study showed the proinﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory cytokine proﬁle shifted
toward a pro-inﬂammatory state in peripheral blood of RIF
patients. Further study will be needed to explore the exact
mechanism.
