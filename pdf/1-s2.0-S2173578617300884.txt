Abstract
Introduction: Technological advances have prompted a change in the management of urolithiasis. Endourological techniques are gaining importance because they are highly effective
treatments. The aim of this study was to answer the question of whether extracorporeal shock
wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is still a competitive alternative compared with other therapeutic
modalities.
Acquisition of evidence: We conducted a literature search of articles published in the past 5
years. We identiﬁed 12 randomized and comparative studies and assessed the methodology and
results of the study variables. We performed a narrative synthesis of the included studies. To
summarize the variables, we used the mean and standard deviation for continuous variables
and absolute numbers and percentages for the qualitative variables.
Analysis of the evidence: Of the studies reviewed, 7 evaluated the various treatments for
nephrolithiasis and 5 evaluated the treatments for ureteral lithiasis. At the renal level, a stonefree rate of 33.33---91.5% at 3 months was reached with ESWL, while a rate of 90.4---100% was
achieved with the other endourological techniques, without ﬁnding statistically signiﬁcant differences in the studies. At the ureteral level, a stone-free rate of 73.5---82.2% at 3 months
was reached with ESWL, while a rate of 79---94.1% was achieved with the other endourological
techniques, without ﬁnding statistically signiﬁcant differences in the studies.
Conclusion: There is a lack of homogeneity among the published studies. ESWL is a minimally
invasive treatment that with an appropriate technique and patient selection achieves high
effectiveness, thus maintaining an important role at this time.

¿Es la litotricia extracorpórea por ondas de choque en la actualidad un tratamiento
vigente para el tratamiento de la litiasis urinaria? Revisión sistemática
Resumen
Introducción: Los avances tecnológicos han motivado un cambio en el manejo de la urolitiasis. Las técnicas endourológicas están cobrando mayor importancia, ya que son tratamientos
altamente eﬁcaces. El objetivo de este trabajo es responder a la cuestión de si la LEOCH sigue
siendo una alternativa competitiva frente a otras modalidades terapéuticas.
Adquisición de la evidencia: Se realizó una búsqueda bibliográﬁca de artículos publicados en
los últimos 5 años. Fueron identiﬁcados 12 estudios aleatorizados y comparativos. Se evaluó la
metodología y el resultado de las variables estudiadas. Se ha realizado una síntesis narrativa de
los estudios incluidos. Para resumir las variables se ha utilizado la media y la desviación estándar
en variables continuas, y para variables cualitativas el número absoluto y el porcentaje.
Análisis de la evidencia: De los estudios revisados, 7 trabajos evaluaban los distintos tratamientos para litiasis renales y 5 para litiasis ureterales. A nivel renal, con LEOCH se alcanza una TLL a
los 3 meses entre 91,5-33,33%, mientras que con otras técnicas endourológicas entre 100-90,4%,
sin encontrar diferencias estadísticamente signiﬁcativas en todos los estudios. A nivel ureteral
con LEOCH se alcanza una TLL a los 3 meses entre 82,2-73,5%, mientras que con otras técnicas
endourológicas entre 94,1-79%, sin encontrar diferencias estadísticamente signiﬁcativas todos
los estudios.
Conclusión: Existe una falta de homogeneidad entre los estudios publicados. La LEOCH es un
tratamiento mínimamente invasivo, que con una adecuada técnica y selección del paciente
alcanza una elevada efectividad, manteniendo un papel importante en la actualidad.

Introduction

Evidence acquisition

With the development of extracorporeal shock wave
lithotripsy (ESWL) in the 1980s as a treatment for urinary
lithiasis, there was a signiﬁcant change in the management
of this condition. Open surgery, which until now had been the
standard treatment, was displaced by a technique that was
minimally invasive, effective and with a low complication
rate.
Subsequently, contraindications to the use of ESWL in
certain patients, as well as their complications, led to
the onset of endourology. Due to the development and
technological advances achieved in medicine, we are witnessing a new change in the management of urolithiasis.
Ureteroscopy (URS), retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) or
percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) are becoming more
important among clinical urological practice, as they are
highly effective treatments that allow a stone-free rate
(SFR) to be achieved in a single surgical intervention.
These changes are also reﬂected in the number of scientiﬁc publications. Currently, there is a tendency to decrease
the work on ESWL and increase studies on endourological
technique.1
The treatment of lithiasis is gaining importance because
it allows for its elimination in a single procedure compared
to a less invasive treatment, although with a higher rate of
retreatment. In this situation, we ask ourselves if we are
facing the onset of the disappearance of ESWL, just as it did
decades ago with open surgery.
The aim of this study is to try to answer the question of
whether ESWL is still a competitive alternative compared to
other therapeutic modalities.

Search strategy
A literature search was conducted in PubMed of articles published in the last ﬁve years. We used as search
criteria the terms: Ureteroscopy/retrograde intrarenal
surgery/Flexible ureteroscopy/RIRS or percutaneous
nephrolithotomy/percutaneous
lithotripsy/PCNL
or
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy/ESWL.

Inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria for the selection and revision of the
articles obtained were:
• Studies published in the last ﬁve years.
• Written in English or Spanish.
• Randomized and comparative studies of the use of ESWL
for the treatment of urinary lithiasis (renal or ureteral)
versus other endourological techniques (URS, RIRS, PCNL).
• Studies in adult population.
• Studies that include at least among the variables studied
the SFR and the complications associated with the applied
treatment.

Systematic review process
Studies that met the inclusion criteria described above were
evaluated for the analysis of evidence. The methodology
and results of the variables studied in each of them were

assessed: SFR, efﬁciency coefﬁcient (EC), complication rate,
retreatment index, mean number of procedures, as well as
mean operative time.
Of the 487 articles included in the initial search that
responded to the terms used, a total of 29 studies compared
the effectiveness of lithotripsy versus other techniques.
After an initial screening of titles and abstracts, it was
observed that 10 were review papers, 6 corresponded to
retrospective or non-randomized studies and 13 were articles on comparative and randomized studies of the results
of the application of ESWL versus other endourological techniques such as treatment of urolithiasis. Of these, one was
dismissed due to multiple errors of published results and
only 12 papers were selected. Seven studies evaluated the
results of the application of the different techniques at the
renal level and 5 of them at the ureteral level (Fig. 1).

Data acquisition
The data were extracted by PB and reviewed by a second
author (AB) to avoid possible errors in obtaining and summarizing them.

Data analysis
A narrative synthesis of the included studies was conducted.
To summarize the variables, the mean and standard deviation (SD) was used for continuous variables, and absolute
number and percentage for qualitative variables. The main
variables analyzed were SFR and EC. Secondary variables
were the complication rate, the operative time, the retraction index and the average number of procedures.

Evidence analysis
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the basic characteristics of the
included studies in which the treatment outcome was evaluated and compared using different renal and ureteral
lithiasis techniques, respectively.
All groups underwent ESWL on an outpatient basis, and all
other techniques required hospitalization. Except for Deem
et al.8 and Lopes Neto et al.,10 ESWL was performed under
general anesthesia. Other studies applied lithotripsy session
under intravenous sedation. The RIRS, URS, miniPerc, PCNL

and laparoscopic techniques were performed under general
anesthesia.
Some studies evaluated and compared the average operative time. The average time for performing a lithotripsy
session was between 12.2 ± 5.16 and 49.2 ± 1.7 min,2,3,5,12
the average surgical time of the URS was 39.1 ± 1.5 min,12
the mean operative time for RIRS was between 44 ± 7.4
and 78.7 ± 20.03 min2---6 and the mean operative time
for minipercutaneous surgery was 61.1 ± 1.3 min.2 Vilches
et al.5 and Javanmard et al.6 found statistically signiﬁcant
differences between the surgical times used to perform
ESWL and RIRS.
The SFR results are shown in Table 3 according to the
follow-up times in which it was evaluated. Except two
studies2,8 that did not indicate the maximum size of the
residual lithiasis with which the patient was considered free
of renal lithiasis, the rest of the groups considered the resolution of the renal lithiasis when in the imaging tests no renal
calculi remains were observed, or these were smaller than
3 mm. Most studies2,4---8 use noncontrast computed tomography (ncCT) for outcome assessment. Singh et al.3 evaluated
the resolution of renal lithiasis using urinary tract radiography and ultrasound.
Vilches et al.5 conducted a stratiﬁed analysis of SFR
according to calculi size and observed that for calculi sized
between 1 and 1.5 cm the SFR was 41.2% for ESWL and
75% for RIRS. Those differences were statistically signiﬁcant
(p = 0.006). Sener et al.4 analyzed and compared EC between
the different techniques. An EC of 0.85, 0.79 and 0.09 was
observed for RIRS, ESWL and the control group respectively,
without evaluating the statistical signiﬁcance of the results.
For the evaluation and comparison of complications,
most studies used modiﬁed Clavien---Dindo classiﬁcation.2,7
None of the studies showed statistically signiﬁcant differences between the techniques evaluated. Table 4 shows the
total percentage of complications in the different studies.
Some studies evaluated the percentage of retreatments
for the resolution of renal lithiasis.2,3,6,8 For ESWL, it is
between 36---67%; 2.1---9.5% for RIRS; 2.2% for minipercutaneous renal surgery and 0% for PCNL. Those differences are
statistically signiﬁcant in all studies. Sener et al.4,7 also studied the mean number of procedures for ESWL, ranging from
1.48 ± 0.65 to 2.7 ± 0.4 according to the different studies,
and was signiﬁcantly higher than for RIRS.4
Table 5 details SFR and EC of the treatment of renal lithiasis in proximal ureter. All the studies evaluated the outcome
of the intervention using a simple radiography of the urinary
tract and only the group of Lopes-Neto et al.10 used ncCT in
the case of diagnostic doubt.
Isalam et al.11 evaluated and compared the treatment
of distal ureteral calculi by URS or ESWL reaching a SFR at
3 months (size of residual fragment is not deﬁned as nonsigniﬁcant) of 94.1% and 73.5%, respectively (p = 0.001) and
an EC of 0.818 for URS and of 0.532 for ESWL.
For the evaluation and comparison of complications
between the different techniques at the ureteral level,
most studies 11---13 conducted a descriptive study of the
same, while Lopes Neto et al.10 and Ozturk et al.9 classiﬁed them according to the modiﬁed Clavien---Dindo scale.
Table 6 describes the total complication rate.
When analyzing those studies that share the same
methodology in the performance of ESWL,2,4,7,9,11,12 it is

observed that for the treatment of renal calculi with ESWL,
SFR at 3 months is reached up to 92%.4 At the ureteral level,
SFR at 3 months is 84.9%. The percentage of complications
with extracorporeal lithotripsy is between 5.7% and 7.4%
(Table 7).
No study included in this study performs a cost analysis
according to the different techniques used in the treatment
of urolithiasis.

Discussion
ESWL, as well as endourological techniques, are highly
effective treatments for the treatment of urinary lithiasis.
Selecting the best therapeutic modality for each patient is
a point of controversy for the urologist.
The results of prospective and randomized studies
comparing these techniques help to draw conclusions in

therapeutic decision making. When we do not have multicentric studies, it is important to observe if the mythology
used in different studies, as well as the analyzed variables,
are coincident. After the literature review, we observed a
lack of homogeneity in the deﬁnition of the main variables
studied. They use different times for the evaluation of SFR
and consider different sizes for the non-signiﬁcant residual
fragment. Studies in the literature did not use the same scale
to classify the complications of the different techniques
used.
In our opinion, it is necessary to unify evaluation criteria.
In order to evaluate the outcome of a technique, it would be
necessary to deﬁne pure SFR, which would correspond to the
absence of renal calculi after treatment, and residual SFR,
which would include the persistence of non-signiﬁcant residual fragments. Consequently, the patient would be identiﬁed
with lithiasic fragments that could cause recurrence of the
disease. The size of those fragments as well as the follow-up
time is also a point of discrepancy among studies. The majority considered as a non-signiﬁcant residual fragment when
the size is smaller than 3 mm at 3 months of the intervention.
However, recent studies14 have shown that fragments of
4 mm, which are considered clinically insigniﬁcant, caused
44% of related events after one-year follow-up, of which up
to 29% were reoperations. In addition, it should be agreed
upon the ideal follow-up moment to assess the result of
the applied technique. Most studies considered the optimal
time 3 months of follow-up, giving a margin for the expulsion of fragments, as demonstrated by studies comparing
the variable at different times of treatment.6,7
Another difference lies in what is the ideal method of
valuing the outcome of the intervention. The image test
should be standardized in order to make a proper comparison
of the different studies. A sensitivity of up to 97% has been
described with ncCT for the diagnosis of urolithiasis. It is
the best complementary examination compared to others.15
However, if we consider the dose of radiation emitted and
that many patients will present a chronic disease in need of
retreatment, ncCT is not the ideal test for follow-up. The
combination of plain radiography and ultrasound achieves
a sensitivity of up to 89%, a speciﬁcity of 100%, a positive
predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of
81%.16 Therefore, it should be considered a valid option for
the control of renal lithiasis initially radiopaque.17
Few studies4,10,12 include EC as variable study for the
evaluation of the results of the applied technique. Clayman

et al.18 deﬁned a concept that includes, besides the outcome
of the technique used, the necessary auxiliary procedures
and retreatments. This variable allows distinguishing among
patients who are solved with a single technique or those who
have needed other procedures. We consider that EC should
be the main outcome variable, as SFR may be an isolated
parameter of the effectiveness of a technique alone, the
EC, however, allows a more accurate comparison between
different therapeutic alternatives.
Regarding the evaluation of complications, most of the
groups use the modiﬁed Clavien---Dindo scale for classiﬁcation. We consider that Clavien---Dindo scale does not fully
conform to the speciﬁc characteristics of ESWL. For this
reason, our group is working on the development of a new
classiﬁcation that is more coherent and adapted to the
technique, which also includes the concepts of the area
of treatment complication and related isocosts. This classiﬁcation will homogenize the classiﬁcation criteria among
the different centers and lithotriptors. This classiﬁcation is
under external validation.19
When we analyze the results of the reviewed studies,
most of them evaluate the treatment of renal calculi in the
lower pole, probably because of the anatomical difﬁculty
involved in the treatment. At this level, with ESWL, SFR
is reached between 48.3% and 92% and in RIRS the SFR is
between 70.8 and 82.85%; not all studies reporting statistically signiﬁcant differences. On the contrary, the difference
in efﬁcacy of ESWL versus PCNL is signiﬁcant. Zhang et al.20
and Srisubat et al.21 conducted study reviews and metaanalysis where treatment of ureteral lithiasis was compared
by RIRS, PCNL and ESWL. They concluded that for both the
lower calyx and the rest of renal locations, PNL is the technique that best SFR reaches, but at the expense of longer
hospital stay. Regarding the treatment of ureteropelvic junction or located in the middle and upper calyx, we considered
that other studies would be necessary to obtain conclusions.
Javanmard et al.6 conducted a study of obese patients,
representing a selection bias in favor of endourological techniques. Deem et al.8 evaluated the treatment of lithiasis
located in the middle and upper calyceal stones, and they
only reach a SFR at 3 months with ESWL 33% of patients. This
result is lower than other studies that, despite trying renal
lithiasis in the lower calyceal stones, they obtained better
outcomes.2,7
The SFR results are not consistent among studies. Studies
comparing the treatment of lithiasis in the proximal ureter

Lopes Neto et al.10 and Manzoor et al.13 obtained best SFR

According to these results, there are studies in the literature
review on the treatment of proximal ureteral calculi greater
than 1 cm and they report greater effectiveness for endourological treatment.22 In a study review and meta-analysis, Cui
et al.23 also found greater efﬁciency with ureteroscopy, but
with a higher complication rate and hospital stay.
According to studies published in the last ﬁve years, there
is not enough scientiﬁc evidence to believe that endourological techniques have displaced extracorporeal lithotripsy in
the treatment of urolithiasis and we are at the beginning of
the end of the ESWL era. ESWL continues to represent a valid
therapeutic tool in clinical practice with its advantages and
disadvantages and, therefore, with speciﬁc indications.
Nowadays, we have several options of minimally invasive treatment. The appropriate choice will depend on the
characteristics of the lithiasis (size, radiological density
and location), patient characteristics (BMI, skin-to-stone
distance, skeletal deformities, hemorrhagic diathesis, pregnancy, urinary tract anatomy), available technology, the
experience of the surgeon, the success rates of each technique in the hands of the operator, failure predictors of the
technique and patient preference.
There have been signiﬁcant advances in the technology of lithotripters. ESWL is considered as a technique of
choice for the treatment of ureteral stones smaller than
1 cm and a renal level up to 2 cm. The new devices generate waves with higher positive peak pressure, the focal
areas are smaller and their application is better tolerated by
patients. The main advantages of ESWL compared to other
endourological techniques are the following: it is less invasive, the possibility of being performed under intravenous
sedation with good tolerability and favorable safety proﬁle.
The key to optimizing the result is to make the appropriate
selection of the patients who are candidate for this technique. Technological advances in image diagnosis facilitate
the identiﬁcation of renal lithiasis susceptible to treatment
with ESWL. The low-dose ncCT is now available, and provides
detailed information on the characteristics of renal lithiasis
and urinary anatomy. It is possible to accurately measure
the focal length, the density of the stone, and the size.
Those three factors that Tran et al.24 described as triple
D score have an inverse correlation with the fragmentation
of renal stones. If the skin-to-stone distance is signiﬁcant
(>10 cm) the effectiveness of ESWL decreases, therefore,
in these cases endourological techniques may be the best
choice. The size of the renal lithiasis is an important factor
for the assessment of the therapeutic decision. The quantiﬁcation of the renal lithiasis should be standardized to
facilitate comparisons between studies. The location of the
renal lithiasis, together with the anatomical characteristics
of the urinary tract, are relevant factors in decision making. The presence of distal stenoses to the position of the
renal lithiasis or non-favorable calyceal anatomical factors
signiﬁcantly limits the use of ESWL and occasionally RIRS.
Radiological densities above 900 HU predict a decrease in
the effectiveness of ESWL. Most of the studies included in
this study do not specify these factors as inclusion/exclusion

P. Bahílo Mateu et al.
criteria according to the treatment technique. In our opinion, they should be considered in order to optimize the
effectiveness of the different techniques and to compare
the results.
Another important factor in the success of ESWL is
the careful performance of the procedure. Some authors
demonstrated that ESWL can get comparable or even better results than other endourological techniques.4,9,12 In our
experience, the technique must be performed by an expert
urologist, as she or he achieves optimal control of the parameters that determine the success of the intervention. It is
necessary an adequate management of energy application
for fragmentation of renal stones, patient placement and
constant monitoring of renal lithiasis location by radioscopy
or ultrasound, as well as the correct administration of analgesic drugs to minimize patient movement. The increase of
the energy applied in the renal lithiasis is an important factor in the effectiveness of the technique. In a retrospective
study, Budía Alba et al.25 did not ﬁnd differences in the rate
of complications in implementing more energy by increasing
the number of waves per session. They observed a significant improvement of clinical effectiveness and reduced
retreatment. A subsequent prospective study has conﬁrmed
the initial results of more effectivity (75% in the standard
treatment vs 87.7% in the extended treatment) without an
increase in observed complications.26
We do not have randomized and comparative studies that evaluate the different treatments in terms of
cost-effectiveness. Selecting the best treatment modality
according to the economic cost represents a point of controversy in urology. At the same time, it is a challenge for the
urologist due to the advantages and disadvantages of each
method regardless of costs. We agree with Cone et al.27 in
that clinical decisions should not be based only in terms of
costs, but we should analyze the total cost of each technique
before deciding on a treatment option.
According to the literature reviewed, despite the
heterogeneity and limited quality of cost-effectiveness
assessments available, most studies have shown that the
URS is more favorable than ESWL for ureteral lithiasis
treatment.28 However, there are signiﬁcant differences
between effectiveness and cost depending on countries and
technologies. In the evaluations conducted in the USA, in a
systematic review conducted by Matlaga et al.28 described
that the URS was associated with better SFR and lower
cost than ESWL. But the authors acknowledge that it is
difﬁcult to assess the magnitude of the URS beneﬁt over
cost, given the wide variety of existing health systems. In
Egypt, Salem et al.29 found similar results in a prospective study of urolithiasis in proximal ureter. Yet, studies in
Asia showed that the higher cost of lithotripsy was linked
to the cost of acquiring and maintaining the lithotripter.
Compared with European and American studies, the costs
associated with ESWL were very low, as lithotripters are
produced by themselves and the acquisition and maintenance costs are signiﬁcantly reduced.30 Our group has
shown that in the Spanish health system the ESWL is
more cost-effective in both renal and ureteral stones, with
no difference in the complication rate between the two
modes.31,32

Is extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy a current treatment for urolithiasis?

Conclusions
According to the literature reviewed in the last ﬁve years
there is a lack of homogeneity among the different studies
that evaluate and compare the treatment of urolithiasis by
different techniques. ESWL plays an important role in the
treatment of renal calculi in the urinary tract. It is a minimally invasive treatment that with an adequate technique
and selection of the patient achieves high effectiveness.
