Abstract
Introduction: The progressive reduction in the caliber of the tract in percutaneous kidney
surgery to the point of miniaturization has expanded its use to smaller stones that until now
have been treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and retrograde intrarenal
surgery (RIRS).
Objective: To provide an update on the various techniques of small-caliber nephrolithotomy
(SC-PCNL) analyze their efﬁcacy, safety and indications and determine their degree of implantation at this time.
Material and methods: We performed a review in PubMed of Spanish and English medical literature on the various techniques of SC-PCNL.
Results: The use of SC-PCNL has reduced the morbidity associated with standard PCNL, particularly bleeding, and has enabled tubeless nephrolithotomy with greater safety. There are various
techniques with blurred terminology (Miniperc, Microperc, Mini-microperc, Ultraminiperc),
which differ in terms of gauge employed and in certain technical aspects that require their
indications be speciﬁed. Currently, SC-PCNL competes with techniques that are less invasive
than standard PCNL such as ESWL and the RIRS in treating small stones, but the role of SC-PCNL
is still not sufﬁciently understood and continues to be the subject of debate.
Conclusions: The indications for PCNL are expanding to small stone sizes due to the miniaturization of the technique. PCNL competes in this ﬁeld with ESWL and RIRS. Larder studies are
needed to establish the speciﬁc indications for PCNL in treating nephrolithiasis.

Nefrolitectomía percutánea de calibre reducido (NLP-CR). Algoritmo de decisión
terapéutica
Resumen
Introducción: La progresiva reducción del calibre del tracto en cirugía percutánea renal, hasta
alcanzar la miniaturización, ha expandido su utilización a litiasis de menor tamaño que hasta
ahora se trataban mediante litotricia extracorpórea por ondas de choque (LEOCH) y cirugía
retrógrada intrarrenal (CRIR).
Objetivo: Realizar una puesta al día de las diferentes técnicas de nefrolitectomía de calibre reducido (NLP-CR) analizando su eﬁcacia, seguridad e indicaciones, así como su grado de
implantación en la actualidad.
Material y métodos: Realizamos una revisión en PubMed de la literatura en castellano e inglés
sobre las diferentes técnicas de NLP-CR.
Resultados: La NLP-CR ha disminuido la morbilidad asociada a la NLP estándar, particularmente
el sangrado, y ha posibilitado la nefrolitectomía tubeless con mayor seguridad. Existen diferentes técnicas con confusa terminología (miniperc, microperc, mini-microperc, ultraminiperc)
que se diferencian en el calibre que emplean y en determinados aspectos técnicos que hacen
que sus indicaciones deban ser precisadas. Actualmente, la NLPCR compite con técnicas menos
invasoras que la NLP estándar, como la LEOCH y la CRIR en el tratamiento de las litiasis de
pequeño tamaño, pero todavía su papel no está suﬁcientemente esclarecido y es aún motivo
de debate.
Conclusiones: Las indicaciones de la NLP se están expandiendo a tamaños litiásicos más
pequeños debido a la miniaturización de la técnica, compitiendo en este campo con LEOCH y
CRIR. Precisamos mayores estudios para establecer sus indicaciones precisas en el tratamiento
de la litiasis renal.

Introduction
Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is currently considered the standard treatment for renal calculi larger than
2 cm1,2 but also for lithiases of 1---2 cm located in the renal
lower pole with unfavorable factors for extracorporeal shock
wave lithotripsy (ESWL), as recommended by the European
guidelines on urolithiasis.3 Since its initial description by
Fernström,4 PCNL has undergone signiﬁcant changes in various aspects that have increased its efﬁcacy and safety.
Different patient positions have been described in the
literature,5---7 as well as new energies of fragmentation have
emerged,8 different ways of dilating the tract9 and various
calibers have been arisen. All those different approaches to
treat PCNL have had a varying degree of acceptance among
the urological community. The reduction of the caliber of
the tract has had a great importance in percutaneous kidney
surgery for the possibility of reducing complications inherent to dilatation. In addition to this, it is possible to reduce
nephrostomy tube caliber or prevent it, and consequently
improve the postoperative comfort of the patient.8
In 1998, Jackman10 described a mini-percutaneous
nephrolithotomy (m-PCNL) procedure in order to adapt
the technique used in adults to the anatomy of the
child. Subsequently, the m-PCNL technique was used
successfully in adults.11---13 Later on, advances in endoscopic technology and energy-based fragmentation have
brought along substantial reductions in caliber, namely,
‘microperc’,14 ‘mini-microperc’15 and ‘ultra-miniperc’,16
which have miniaturized percutaneous nephrolithotomy and

have expanded the role of PCNL in the treatment of lithiasis.
At present, m-PCNL competes with techniques that are
less invasive than standard PCNL, such as ESWL and retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) in treating small stones.
However, the role of m-PCNL is still not sufﬁciently understood and continues to be a subject of debate.
Our objective is to evaluate the scientiﬁc evidence that
would answer the following questions: 1) is the reduction
of the tract beneﬁcial? 2) what calibers are currently in
use in PCNL?; and 3) in which cases are the use of calibers
recommended?

Evidence acquisition
A literature review was performed using the PubMed
database between 1975 and 2016 that included keywords from the Medical Subject Headings: percutaneous
nephrolithotomy, minipercutaneous nephrolithotomy, ultraminipercutaneous nephrolithotomy and micropercutaneous
nephrolithotomy. A total of 6199 articles were found, of
which 250 were selected from studies of both experimental animals and humans, conducted in adults and pediatric,
and published in English. Of these, 93 articles were selected
that analyzed the different calibers used in the percutaneous renal surgery for the treatment of renal calculi. We
examined the results and complications of those studies to
determine the most optimal indications for percutaneous
renal surgery depending on the factors that deﬁne successes
and side effects reactions.

Evidence synthesis
We reviewed each of the selected studies to answer the
questions set as objectives.

Arguments in favor of reducing the size of the
caliber
Although PCNL represented a scientiﬁc progress on open
surgery of calculi in terms of morbidity and postoperative
reduction, with success rates ranging from 76% to 98%, it
also entailed non-negligible rates of complications.17 Bleeding, both intraoperatively and postoperatively, is the most
common complication, with transfusion rates ranging from
2% to 23%.17---19 It seems evident that performing dilation
to create a conventional nephrostomy tract may damage
vessels adjacent to it. Although experimental studies in animals demonstrate that alterations in renal structure and
function are similar when comparing sequential dilation to
balloon dilation,20 we have sufﬁcient evidence on the relevant role of the caliber of the tract as predisposing factor
of bleeding.18,21---24
Traxer,25 in his experimental study with pigs, demonstrated that the dilation of the tract will cause injury in the
renal parenchyma that will be replaced by a scar, with the
consequent area of ischemia and small loss of renal function.
The author compares the damage produced by a mini percutaneous tract in the renal parenchyma versus a conventional
tract, ﬁnding no volume differences in the parenchymal scar
(0.63% for m-PCNL vs. 0.91% for standard PCNL). Thus, the
study by Traxer demonstrated that the volume of damaged
renal parenchyma does not exceed 1% of the total in both
accesses.25 However, these studies also report that the tissue adjacent to the tract suffers damage, recognizing areas
of interstitial inﬂammation and ischemia in the tissue that
can evolve to healing as well.
The lack of information that we have about the actual
damage that the tract produces in the papilla after healing
has also been pointed out. It is estimated that the damage
of the collecting ducts at that level may be undervalued and
that the loss of global function may be greater than the one
estimated so far, particularly when several tracts are used.26
On the other hand, the caliber of the tract should be
adapted to the particular intrarenal anatomy of the patient.
Unlike ﬂexible ureteroscopy, where we manage parameters
such as infundibular length and width to identify patients
with ‘unfavorable calyceal anatomy’,27 the priority when
choosing the access calyx in PCNL has been the tuning of the
axis of it with the lithiasis and the subcostal situation, without considering the conciliation between calyceal anatomy
and caliber of the tract, since the latter was conditioned by
the available technology.
Another argument in favor of reducing the caliber of the
tract is the possibility of performing tubeless PCNL with
greater safety. Several comparative studies had pointed
out the possibility of reducing postoperative pain and hospital stay by replacing the 22---28 Fr caliber nephrostomy
tube with a 9---10 Fr pigtail catheter, with no difference
in bleeding.28,29 That led to ﬁnishing PCNL without leaving nephrostomy. The concept of tubeless PCNL is almost
as old as PCNL,30 although early complications reported by

J.H. Amón Sesmero et al.
few patients made the original idea of Wickham not to have
a broad endorsement.31
In 1997, Bellman32 demonstrated the safety and beneﬁts
of this clinical experiment on 50 patients in a case-control
study, and although there are clear restrictions on tubeless
PCNL,33,34 according to a recent review, it is currently supported by more than 19 randomized comparative studies.8
The use of sealant substances, that are necessary when
standard caliber tracts are used,35---37 raises controversy due
to the risk of lithiasis formation.38 Reducing the caliber of
the m-PCNL tract could obviate the use of sealants when
the tract is occluded spontaneously. Miniaturized calibers
of PCNL, m-PCNL and ultra-mini PCNL are associated with
tubeless intervention.14---16
Therefore, in order to reduce morbidity associated with
calibers used by standard PCNL, and in the light of technological improvements, there have been changes in the
instruments and in some aspects of this surgical technique.

Classiﬁcation of percutaneous nephrolithotomy
according to the caliber of the tract
PCNL has been performed since its origins with Amplazt from
26 Fr to 30 Fr. The caliber is appropriate to make way for the
nefroscopes designed for this technique. Other authors have
considered the 24 Fr caliber also as standard.39
When the PCNL was adapted to the pediatric population, the so called m-PCNL technique was ﬁrst performed
in a child using 15 Fr Hickman catheter sleeve and a 10 Fr40
caliber infant cystoscope. Subsequently, Jackman10 systematized the technique by operating on 11 children with
an 11 Fr gauge provided by a catheter designed for such
purpose. Then, the technique was applied in adults and
the same author used a 13 Fr11 caliber. In other initial
studies, Monga and Lahme used 20 Fr and 15 Fr sheaths,
respectively.12,13 In 2007, the Storz team developed mPCNL system with 18 Fr, 19.5 Fr, and 24 Fr sheaths that
accommodate a 12 Fr nephroscope (Fig. 1), and shortly
thereafter Wolf designed a similar equipment of sheaths of
15Fr and 18 Fr and nephroscope of 14 Fr.41 There seemed to
be consensus in deﬁning m-PCNL as any PCNL employing a
caliber equal to or lower than 20 Fr in a range that decreased
to 11 Fr.11,13,42,43 But with the description of the microperc14
and later the ultra-mini PCNL16 and mini-microperc,15 the
caliber was redeﬁned for m-PCNL. Microperc employs a
4.8 Fr caliber with optics of 0. 9 mm.14 Ultra-mini PCNL
uses sheaths from 11 Fr to 13 Fr with miniature nephroscope
6 Fr,16 and mini-microperc is a subsequent modiﬁcation of
microperc 8 Fr.15
A recent review concludes that a correct terminology
would deﬁne m-PCNL as all PCNL using tract sized from 14 Fr
to 20 Fr, ultra-mini PCNL from 11 Fr to 13 Fr, mini-microperc
for 8 Fr gauge and microperc for 4.8 Fr gauge.39
PCNL with 22 Fr caliber would therefore be unclassiﬁed.
One of the few references in the literature to this caliber is a
retrospective study comparing the different sizes of Amplatz
sheath from 22 Fr to 30 Fr. According to their ﬁndings, the
fall in hemoglobin was signiﬁcantly lower and the creatinine level signiﬁcantly higher in patients treated with large
Amplatz compared to the 22 Fr calibre.44

In view of the complexity of terms referring to the caliber, it has been proposed to simplify the nomenclature of
PCNL-CR, referring to the strict size of the tract used as follows: PCNL+30 , PCNL+20 , PCNL+12 , etc.45 or also establish an
equivalence of the gauges with the nomenclature of the following sizes: XL, L, M, S, XS and XSS which would correspond
to calibers greater than 25 Fr, 20 Fr to <25 Fr, 15 Fr to < 20 Fr,
10 Fr to < 15 Fr, 5 Fr to < 10 Fr and < 5 Fr, respectively.46

Mini-percutaneous nephrolithotomy/miniperc
The ﬁrst reduction in caliber was reported by Helal in 1997,
when treating a small-size lithiasis in a 2-year-old child,
using a child cystoscope inserted through a 15 Fr tract provided by a peelable vascular sheath.40 Then, as discussed
above, it was Jackman who coined the term ‘miniperc’ or
mini-PCNL to treat 11 children with lithiasis smaller than
2 cm using an 11 Fr tract, achieving a success rate of 85%
without describing complications.10 When the technique was
transferred to the adult, preliminary studies showed success rates comparable to standard PCNL on lithiases smaller
than 2 cm. Jackman applied it in 9 adults with lithiases
smaller than or equal to 2 cm, achieving a success rate of
89% without mentioning complications.11 Chan42 reported
a success rate of 94% in 17 patients, using a 13 Fr sheath.
Monga,12 using a 20 Fr sheath, reaches a success rate of
90% in 21 patients, reporting only complications in one
case. Shortly after, Lahme13 achieved similar results in 19
patients, referring only to a pyelonephritis as a complication. All the authors noted the lower morbidity of this

555

technique over standard PCNL, although this consideration
had no scientiﬁc support since none of those studies compared both techniques. A recent publication of more than
1300 patients undergoing m-PCNL-16 Fr reported a success
rate of 82%, with a complication rate of 20.1%. Those results
are apparently similar to the ones obtained in standard
PCNL, although in this series of cases most were Clavien 1
and 2 and only 3.5% were Clavien 3.47
The results obtained in early comparative studies were
not encouraging. The experimental study by Traxer discussed above, which compares the damage produced by an
11 Fr tract versus a 30 Fr tract in the renal parenchyma of
the pig, did not justify the reduction of the caliber since the
lesion was similar.25 In a retrospective study, Giusti48 compared m-PCNL, standard PCNL and tubeless PCNL, ﬁnding
worse results in m-PCNL in terms of success rate and operating time, and although this technique had shorter hospital
stay than standard PCNL, it did not exceed tubeless PCNL.
In another prospective, non-randomized study of 50 consecutive patients comparing PCNL with 26 Fr Amplatz versus
m-PCNL18 Fr, differences were found only in the minor hospitalization and postoperative pain of the m-PCNL. However,
there was a bias in the results due to the difference in the
lithiasic size of the treated patients.22
Subsequent comparative studies that are better designed
have supported the statement that m-PCNL has lower morbidity. Cheng,49 in a prospective randomized study with
standard PCNL (24 Fr) versus m-PCNL (16 Fr) in three groups
of patients (staghorn stones, renal pelvis and complex
calyceal stones), showed a signiﬁcantly lower bleeding rate
that required transfusion for m-PCNL (10.4% for PCNL-24 Fr
vs 1.4% for PCNL-16 Fr). The results showed similar success
rates for the group of staghorn stones and renal pelvis,
but better results for m-PCNL in the complex calyceal
stones group (85.2% vs. 70% for m-PCNL and standard PCNL,
respectively). According to the authors, that is due to
the greater procedure of the m-PCNL sheath compared to
the conventional one. In a prospective case-control study,
Mishra50 included 25 cases of m-PCNL (14 Fr-18 Fr) versus 28
cases of standard PCNL (24---28 Fr) of 1 to 2 cm sized renal
stone. The author found no differences in success rate, and
although the m-PCNL speciﬁed longer operative time than
the standard, it was higher than the latter in the lower drop
in hemoglobin, lower need for analgesia, and shorter hospital stay, noting the additional advantage of the higher rate
of intraoperative conversion to tubeless m-PCNL. A recent
meta-analysis involving 8 studies with 353 m-PCNL and 396
standard PCNL reveals similar stone-free rates in both techniques, showing signiﬁcant differences in favor of m-PCNL
in rates of bleeding, transfusion, pain, and postoperative
stay. Standard PCNL was superior only in the operative
time.51
But m-PCNL should not only be compared to its standard
counterpart, but with less invasive techniques such as ESWL
and RIRS, given the range of lithiasic size in which it has
been used. Zeng52 compares m-PCNL with ESWL in infants
under 3 years of age with lithiasis ranging from 15 to 30 mm,
ﬁnding similar success rates (96% vs 86% for m-PCNL and
ESWL, respectively), but there were signiﬁcant differences
in complication rates and retreatment in favor of m-PCNL.
Kruck,53 in a retrospective study of 482 patients comparing m-PCNL, RIRS and ESWL, points out a signiﬁcantly worse

success rate for the latter, both in the lower pole and in any
other location.
Several studies comparing m-PCNL with RIRS report a
higher success rate, lower cost and no need for a double
J stent in m-PCNL, although they show a greater fall in
hemoglobin.53---56

Microperc
How much could the caliber be reduced in percutaneous
surgery? This question was the basis for the development of micro-percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Bader et al.57
used an optical needle of 0.9 mm diameter connected
to a light source for ultrasound-guided needle aspiration
in 15 patients undergoing PCNL. Shortly thereafter, Desai
expanded the technique by performing the entire procedure through this 4.85 Fr needle.14 The only working channel
was transferring ﬁber optics, irrigation, and a 275 ␮m laser
ﬁber. The miniature PCNL named microperc emerged in this
way. The key was the quality of the micro-optics, which provided sufﬁcient vision to perform the procedure safely and
the main advantage is that there is no need for dilation of
the tract; decreasing the possibility of bleeding. Microperc
is manufactured by PolyDiagnost (Pfaffenhofen, Germany)
with partially inventoried equipment39 (Fig. 2).
Although from 2011 to the present several case series
have been published on small calculi (10---20 mm) in both
children and adults, with success rates around 90% and
complication rates lower than 10%,41,58---64 the number of
treated patients is still small and restricted to a few centers to draw clear conclusions (Table 1). A retrospective
study of 98 patients compared microperc to m-PCNL in
10---20 mm-sized stones in the lower calyx, showing a similar
success rate, but a lower bleeding rate, shorter operative time, shorter hospital stay, and a higher tubeless
rate for microperc.65 Similar results were obtained by both
techniques in pediatric patients with a lithiasic range of
10---20 mm.66
But microperc, given the constraints it has on stone size,
must be confronted with RIRS and ESWL. Sabnis,67 in a
prospective randomized study, compared 35 patients undergoing microperc with 35 patients undergoing RIRS, for a
renal stone size smaller than 15 mm. The success rate and

operating time were similar; however, microperc caused
greater drop in hemoglobin and greater pain, but had less
need for double J stent.67 Fata,68 in a similar study but with
fewer patients, found no signiﬁcant differences between the
two techniques. In contrast, in the lower calyx, microperc was superior to RIRS in a retrospective study of 127
patients with renal stones smaller than 20 mm.69 Microperc
obtained a higher stone-free rate, shorter operative time,
and less need for a double J stent, although the fall in
hemoglobin and postoperative duration were greater with
this technique.69
The literature shows a resolution rate for microperc
equivalent to RIRS and m-PCNL in renal calculi smaller
than 20 mm, and it seems to have a minimally invasive
proﬁle. However, this technique has signiﬁcant limitations.
Unlike m-PCNL, microperc does not allow the use of ﬂexible ureterorenoscopes by anterograde.8 The technique
using 4.8 Fr needle, and even the 8 Fr sheath, due to its
reduced size, is smaller than that achieved with the sheaths
employing m-PCNL, which requires direct access to lithiasis
because tangential trajectories to the stone may invalidate
fragmentation.70 If during this procedure a migration of fragments occurs, we are forced to reconvert the procedure to
RIRS or m-PCNL in order to reach a complete resolution. In
series with a large number of patients, such as Hatipoglu
(n: 140) or Ganpule (n: 139), the rate of reconversion to mPCNL due to migration of remains or poor vision was 8.57%
and 6.47%,41,62 respectively.
Another drawback to be noted is the absence of the
‘venturi’ effect produced by m-PCNL, which enables spontaneous extraction of the lithiasic fragments through the
sheath, and this forces the lithiasis to vaporize to avoid
signiﬁcant debris.41
Finally, a controversial aspect in this ﬁeld is the high
pressures reached in the renal pelvis during some phases
of the intervention due to the absence of drainage through
the micropercutaneous sheath. This technique has proved
to have pressures signiﬁcantly higher than those achieved
with standard PCNL during the different phases of the
intervention.71 The highest pressure reached with microperc was 30.3 mm Hg compared to 20.1 mm Hg with standard
PCNL, which is the threshold pressure for pyelovenous
reﬂux.72 However, the complication rate was similar in both
groups. The question is whether this hyperpresence has or
does not have clinical consequences.71

Ultra-mini PCNL

Ultra-mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (UMP) corresponds to the miniaturized PCNL using 11 Fr to 13 Fr calibers
manufactured by LUT (Leben und Technologie). Once the
18 gauge needle is punched and the guide is passed, the
11 Fr or 13 Fr sheath with its obturator is slid through the
guide without dilation (Figs. 3 and 4). UMP employs a 6 Fr
nephroscope and holmium laser as the only feasible source
of energy for fragmentation.39 UMP offers some advantages
over microperc in relation to its greater caliber, such as the
possibility of extracting small fragments with baskets and
maintaining the ‘venturi effect’ offered by m-PCNL. The ﬁrst
experience with this technique16 comprised 36 patients with
renal calculi smaller than 2 cm in which a success rate of

monotherapy and 90.9% when associated with RIRS.73 In children, UMP achieved better results compared to microperc in
that it will not generate overpressure in the urinary tract.74
A recent randomized comparative study with standard PCNL
in renal stones smaller than 2.5 cm showed equal success
rate for both techniques, but UMP had fewer complications
and required less radiation exposure and shorter operative
time.75

97.2% was achieved per month, with a complication rate of
16.7%. No patient required transfusion, but there were two
cases of sepsis.16
Subsequently, UMP has been performed in renal stones
ranging from 2 to 3 cm, with success rates of 81.8% in

Despite the appearance of this treatment nearly two
decades ago, the indications of the PCNL with reduced calibers are not well deﬁned and the EUA and AUA guidelines
on urolithiasis make few references on their use. A comparative meta-analysis of ESWL, RIRS and reduced caliber PCNL
from 2014 concludes that RIRS should be the ﬁrst choice
of treatment, given its greater efﬁcacy and lesser morbidity, until we have more randomized studies.76 De77 exhibits
the same conclusions in his more recent meta-analysis when
comparing PCNL versus RIRS. In the minimally invasive PCNL
subgroup, the results in both success rate and complications
were favorable for RIRS. Thus, the authors consider that
this technique should be the standard treatment for renal
stones smaller than 2 cm.77 But other studies show favorable
results for m-PCNL except for bleeding.53---56 A recent randomized comparative study for renal stones larger than 1 cm
between m-PCNL and RIRS showed similar success rates,
surgical time, hemoglobin fall and hospital stay, but the
postoperative pain and the need for analgesia was greater
for RIRS.78
Obviously, the standard treatment of renal stones larger
than 2 cm in children is m-PCNL,3 but the indications in the
adult are not yet well clariﬁed and it has been used in renal
stones larger than 2 cm, as well as in renal stones smaller
than 2 cm where ESWL or RIRS42 had previously failed, or
were located in the lower pole.35,54
Initially, Chan42 proposed some accurate recommendations: lithiasic volume between 1 and 2 cm2 , failure or unfavorable lower pole anatomy for ESWL or ureterorenoscopy
(URS), or presence of anatomical abnormality that compromises them, cystine stones smaller than 2 cm2 and as
secondary access to residual calculi in standard PCNL.42 Subsequently, other authors have expanded their indications.
Thus, obstructive uropathy has been used in the treatment
of large proximal ureteral calculi, achieving a higher success

rate, with shorter operative time and less need for retreatment than retrograde ureterorenoscopy.79,80 A randomized
comparative study exposes better results than URS in proximal ureteral stones.81 Even large series of Asian authors
report the use of obstructive uropathy in the treatment of
staghorn stones with multiple tracts.49,82---84 Cheng found no
difference in the success rate between standard PCNL versus m-PCNL in staghorn stones (75.9% vs 72.2%, respectively;
p > 0.05).49 But it seems clear that one of the limitations of
m-PCNL is the time it takes for extracting fragments.22,50
Therefore, its role in large volumes of lithiasis would support
the standard PCNL23 in inaccessible or residual lithiasis,42 or
in surgery combined with RIRS.85,86
In renal stones smaller than 2 cm, m-PCNL is comparable to standard PCNL in success rate, with lower
rate of complications22,84 and is clearly superior to
ESWL in both adults and children, despite its greater
invasiveness.52,53,87---89 M-PCNL provides an interesting fact
that is impeded in microperc and ultra-mini PCNL, such as
the possibility of using ﬂexible ones.8
Microperc seems to have a clear application in pediatric
patients requiring percutaneous surgery to treat small or
moderate size stones.58,61,63,90 The lack of need to insert a
double J stent at the end of the intervention makes this
technique preferable to RIRS in infants.91
But Cheng’s indications are not yet established in adults.
Do microperc and ultra-mini PCNL have a role in the

treatment of adult renal stones? Although neither EAU nor
AUA clinical guidelines mention those techniques due to the
lack of scientiﬁc evidence, the current sparse literature outlines some possible indications for microperc: renal stone
<15 mm with unfavorable anatomy for ESWL or RIRS, auxiliary accesses in the context of multitract PCNL8,39,92 and
its employability in the small diverticulum and horseshoe
kidney.14
Although we do not yet have enough data to identify
possible indications of ultra-mini PCNL due to the limited
experience with this technique, the small caliber used would
offer indications superimposable to microperc, including in
the pediatric population.93 Nonetheless, intrarenal pressure
control and the possibility to perform the venturi effect
and use nitinol baskets to evacuate small fragments could
expand its scope beyond the 15 mm microperc. Fig. 5 summarizes the indications of the different PCNL calibers in
reference to the renal stone size according to the existing
literature.

Conclusions
PCNL developments related to the narrowing of the tract
caliber has changed the indications of this technique,
expanding its scope to smaller sizes that were restricted
to less invasive techniques such as ESWL and RIRS. While
