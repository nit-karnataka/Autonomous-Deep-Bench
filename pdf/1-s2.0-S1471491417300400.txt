CARs: Synthetic
Immunoreceptors for Cancer
Therapy and Beyond
ZeNan L. Chang1,2 and Yvonne Y. Chen1,*
Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are versatile synthetic receptors that provide T cells with engineered speciﬁcity. Clinical success in treating B[536_TD$IF]-cell
malignancies has demonstrated the therapeutic potential of CAR-T cells
against cancer, and efforts are underway to expand the use of engineered T
cells to the treatment of diverse medical conditions, including infections and
autoimmune diseases. [54_TD$IF]Here, we review current understanding of the molecular
properties of CARs, how this knowledge informs the rational design and characterization of novel receptors, the successes and shortcomings of CAR-T cells
in the clinic, and emerging solutions for the continued improvement of CAR-T
cell therapy.

Trends
CAR[62_TD$IF]–T-cell therapy has shown
remarkable clinical efﬁcacy against
B-cell leukemias, but there is signiﬁcant room for improvement in treatments
for
nonhematologic
malignancies.
CAR design has relied heavily on historical experience and trial-and-error.
Accumulating knowledge of T[532_TD$IF]-cell biology, CAR signaling, and rational protein
engineering is facilitating increasingly
sophisticated CAR designs.

Adoptive transfer of T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has shown remarkable clinical efﬁcacy against advanced B[536_TD$IF]-cell malignancies [1–5]. This clinical success has
sparked urgent interest in the development of new CARs and the extension of CAR-T cell
therapy to solid tumors as well as applications beyond cancer. As the ﬁeld accumulates both
research and clinical experience, the potential as well as limitations of this exciting new
therapeutic paradigm are coming into clearer focus. In this review we begin with a discussion
of current understanding of the biology behind CAR expression and signaling, which informs
the rational design of new CAR molecules. We next survey the clinical outcomes of CAR-T cell
therapy trials to date, and discuss challenges highlighted by these bedside experiences. Finally,
we discuss emerging solutions that seek to improve upon current CAR designs and describe
potential applications of CAR-T cell therapy beyond cancer.

Novel in vitro and in vivo characterization methods for CAR function enable
detection of subtle differences [56_TD$IF]across
CAR designs and may better predict
CAR performance in the clinic.
Various
strategies
have
been
employed to generate ‘armored’ T
cells against immunosuppression and
exhaustion, and to improve T[532_TD$IF]-cell
persistence.
Promising preclinical data support the
extension of CAR-T cell therapy to the
treatment of infections and autoimmune diseases.

The Biology of CAR Expression and Mechanism of Signaling
CARs are fusion proteins with well-deﬁned functional domains, including an extracellular
antigen-binding domain, extracellular spacer, transmembrane domain, and [627_TD$IF]intracellular signaling domain responsible for T-cell activation (Figure 1A) [6]. Second- and third-generation
CARs (see Glossary) incorporate one or two additional intracellular costimulatory signaling
domains, respectively, to enhance T[532_TD$IF]-cell activation and proliferation (Figure 1B) [6]. A major
strength of the CAR platform is its modularity, with interchangeable and structurally distinct
options being available for each functional domain (Box 1). This modularity has enabled the
construction of a variety of functional receptor molecules with diverse antigen speciﬁcities and
structural properties. Although a full mechanistic understanding of CAR signaling and its effects
on T[628_TD$IF]-cell biology remains elusive, recent studies on T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling as well as
detailed observations of CAR-T cell behavior in vitro have yielded valuable insights into the
mechanism of CAR function and provide guidance for the design and construction of new
CARs. Unless otherwise noted, all results discussed in this article refer to human conventional
T cells (as opposed to regulatory T cells, Tregs), and all preclinical in vivo results refer to

Effect of CAR Expression on T[58_TD$IF]-cell Biology.
CAR-encoding transgenes are most commonly introduced into CD4+[53_TD$IF] and/or CD8+ T cells via
viral transduction, resulting in strong constitutive CAR expression [2,7–9]. The gross overexpression of potent signaling domains that constitute the CAR, such as CD3z and CD28 or
4-1BB, suggests that CARs have the potential to inﬂuence T-cell biology even in the absence of
antigen stimulation. Indeed, cases of dramatic tonic signaling have been reported for multiple
CAR constructs, with higher basal CAR expression levels correlating with increased tonic
signaling and CAR- [629_TD$IF]T cell exhaustion in the absence of antigen exposure (irresponsive
cytotoxic T cells) [10–12]. It is worth noting that the speciﬁc effects of CAR expression on
T[532_TD$IF]-cell biology appear to correlate more strongly with the type of CAR expressed (e.g., CARs
containing CD28 vs 4-1BB) than with the genetic background of the T cells, as illustrated by
transcriptional proﬁling of CD28 and 4-1BB CAR-T cells generated from multiple donors [10].
Furthermore, the number of costimulatory domains incorporated into CAR molecules has been
shown to affect the basal phosphorylation levels of signaling proteins important in human T[532_TD$IF]- cell
activation (LAT, ZAP-70, SYK, ERK, and LCK) [13], suggesting that the speciﬁc composition of
CAR molecules can profoundly inﬂuence T[532_TD$IF]-cell biology independently of antigen stimulation. A
recent study compared the function of T cells expressing a CD19 CAR that was either randomly

Box 1. CAR Parts
Antigen-Binding Moiety
The antigen-binding domain in a CAR can consist of any target-binding protein provided that the molecule remains
functional when fused to an N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal components that constitute the remainder of the
receptor. Antibody-derived single chain variable fragments (scFvs) are the most commonly used antigen-binding
domains, but CARs have also been constructed with other antibody-derived binding components such as nanobodies
[151] or natural binding partners of the target antigen [65].
Extracellular Spacer
Commonly used extracellular spacers are taken from the CD4, CD8, and CD28 extracellular domains as well as the IgG
Fc region. Amino acid substitutions are often made [623_TD$IF]in the Fc domain to prevent unwanted interactions with Fc g
receptors (FcRg) expressed by cells such as monocytes and natural killer cells [28,152–154].
Transmembrane Domain
CAR transmembrane domains typically consist of the membrane-spanning domain of CD4, CD8, CD28, or CD3z.
Transmembrane domain choice is dictated by whether a molecule remains functional when fused to particular Cterminal signaling domains, and the decision is often based on historical experience. Investigations into CAR signaling
mechanisms may shed light on whether the CAR transmembrane domain functions merely as a structural anchor or
plays additional functional roles.
Costimulatory Domain
Costimulation augments T[532_TD$IF]-cell activation, leading to increased cytokine production, proliferation, differentiation, and
persistence. Costimulatory domains in CARs borrow from a variety of native receptors that shape T[532_TD$IF]-cell activation, and
CD28 and 4-1BB intracellular domains are the most common [6]. The relative contributions of CD28 and 4-1BB to CART cell function have been reviewed extensively elsewhere [32,155]. Efforts to combine the strengths of multiple
costimulatory domains in third-generation CARs have yielded varying results thus far [32,156–162]. The ability to
quantitatively predict the effects of costimulatory signal combinations will likely require a more in-depth mechanistic
understanding of CAR signaling than is currently available.
Activation Domain
CD3z, CD3e, and FcRg intracellular domains were regularly used as the activation domain in ﬁrst-generation CARs, but
CD3z has emerged as the activation domain of choice in recent years [6]. It remains unclear how the use of different
activation domains may alter CAR behavior, but the CD3z activation domain in second-generation CARs has been
sufﬁcient to mediate clinical efﬁcacy in multiple clinical trials [1–5].

integrated via retroviral transduction or site-speciﬁcally integrated into the T[532_TD$IF]-cell receptor a
constant (TRAC) locus or the b2-microglobulin locus, with or without additional promoter/
enhancer elements [12]. The study found that the dynamic pattern of CAR expression regulated
by the native [59_TD$IF]TRAC locus contributed to the most sustained antitumor efﬁcacy in vivo [12],
demonstrating the need to stringently control basal and dynamic CAR expression levels to
achieve optimal therapeutic efﬁcacy. Further investigation [560_TD$IF]is necessary to determine whether
CAR expression from the TRAC locus will serve as a superior strategy across multiple CAR
designs and tumor targets.
CAR Signal Initiation and Transduction
Few studies have directly assessed the mechanism by which CARs convert extracellular
binding events into intracellular signaling. Nevertheless, research on immunoreceptor triggering
and the speciﬁc signaling domains utilized in CARs provide a framework for inferring the
biophysical and biochemical events in CAR signaling.
As discussed in Box 1, the most common signaling domains in CARs are derived from the
cytoplasmic segments of CD3z, CD28, and 4-1BB. Both CD3z and CD28 contain stretches of

positively charged, basic amino[561_TD$IF]-acid residues in their cytoplasmic tails, which are known to
closely interact with the negatively charged inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane when the
receptors are in their resting, ‘off’ state [14–16]. Similarly, 4-1BB contains a basic stretch of
amino acids in its cytoplasmic tail, even though its membrane-interacting capabilities have not
been investigated in detail. For both CD3z, and CD28, receptor triggering leads to dissociation
of the intracellular chains from the plasma membrane, suggesting membrane dissociation as a
crucial step in signal transduction [15,16]. The exact functional role of receptor–membrane
contact remains unclear, but the sequestration of receptor chains inside lipid bilayers could
serve as a means to regulate the availability of binding sites that are crucial for downstream
signaling (Figure 2A) [16,17]. Speciﬁcally, the masking and unmasking of immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) phosphorylation sites on CD3z chains, or the various
signaling-molecule binding sites on CD28, could play a crucial role in signal transduction
[14,16,17]. Furthermore, the conﬁguration of the receptor chains could inﬂuence the clustering
of receptors and their relative location to other membrane-tethered signaling molecules,
thereby altering the initiation and/or maintenance of signal transduction [15,18] [630_TD$IF].
If the association and dissociation of the intracellular domains from the plasma membrane
[562_TD$IF] layed a role in CAR signaling, how might extracellular ligand-binding trigger the intracellular
p
dissociation event? It has been shown that T cell/target cell conjugations can generate
mechanical forces through spontaneous membrane motions and receptor engagement
[19–21]. This observation supports the receptor deformation model of TCR triggering
which posits that the tugging and pulling between a conjugated T cell/target cell pair would
ultimately deform a ligated TCR to a signaling-competent conformation [22] [631_TD$IF]. Target-cell ligation
may similarly provide a mechanical force to dislodge the CAR intracellular domain from the Tcell plasma membrane and trigger receptor signaling (Figure 2B). Such a model, which relies on
general mechanical coupling rather than on speciﬁc binding-induced conformational changes,
is consistent with the fact that functional CARs can be constructed from a variety of [564_TD$IF]domains
with different physical shapes and biochemical properties. If true, this model would suggest that
the extracellular spacer and transmembrane domain of a functional CAR must fall within a given
range of conformational ﬂexibility, and the mechanical properties of these linker domains would
likely impact [632_TD$IF]the sensitivity of a CAR.
The receptor deformation model is only one of several leading hypotheses for TCR signaling.
Another model, termed the kinetic segregation model, posits that TCR signaling is triggered
by the exclusion of bulky phosphatases such as CD45 and CD148 from the compact
immunological synapse formed between a conjugated pair of T[56_TD$IF]-cell and target-cell
membranes [23,24]. It has been shown that cell contacts formed by CAR/cognate ligand
conjugation exclude CD45 [25,26]. Furthermore, head-to-head comparisons of CARs with
different extracellular spacer lengths revealed that a short-spacer CAR is most effective for
targeting membrane-distal epitopes in CD19 and ROR1 [27,28], consistent with the hypothesis
that a compact immunological synapse is essential for [63_TD$IF]CAR signaling by excluding bulky
phosphatases (Figure 2C). However, there is a limit to how close T[56_TD$IF]-cell and target-cell
membranes can favorably come together because of the thick glycocalyx surrounding each
cell and the energy cost of membrane bending [29]. As such, shorter spacer lengths are not
always optimal, particularly when targeting membrane-proximal epitopes [7,28,30], and both
the location of target epitopes and the receptor’s extracellular spacer length are important in
CAR design. In addition to adjusting cell–cell distance in an immunological synapse, spacer
length also affects the mechanical properties of the CAR molecule itself. Therefore, the ability of
the CAR to access target epitopes, achieve phosphatase segregation, and transduce mechanical forces should be considered in concert when selecting target epitopes and designing
corresponding CAR structures.

CAR stimulation yields many of the same signal-transduction events that occur upon TCR
stimulation, such as the phosphorylation of CD3z ITAMs, LCK, ZAP70, and LAT [13]. CARs also
appear to mimic TCRs at the immunological synapse, forming initial microclusters that exclude
CD45 and organizing, together with native receptors, into the characteristic bull’s-eye structure
of the supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC) (Figure 2D) [25,26]. The importance of
clustering in CAR signaling was further highlighted by the observation of a [567_TD$IF]tonically signaling
CAR that led to antigen-independent CAR-T cell exhaustion [10]. The propensity of the CAR[568_TD$IF]’s
extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) domain to spontaneously aggregate was
proposed as the cause of antigen-independent receptor clustering and signaling [10]. These
results suggest that care should be taken to avoid domains with innate oligomerization
tendencies when designing CARs[634_TD$IF], so as to prevent spontaneous receptor clustering that
leads to premature T-cell exhaustion.
The intensity of the costimulatory signal required for proper T[532_TD$IF]-cell activation has been observed
to vary inversely with the extent of TCR stimulation [31]. However, CARs provide hard-coded
stoichiometry between CD3z and costimulatory domains. This ﬁxed dosing of CD3z and
costimulatory domains potentially underlies the observation that a nonfunctional subpopulation
can emerge upon antigen stimulation of second-generation CD19 CARs in both CD4+[532_TD$IF] and
CD8+ T cells [9]. While native costimulatory receptors can still be involved in CAR-T cell
activation, exactly how these native receptors interface with CAR-mediated signaling remains
to be explored. Nevertheless, overexpression of costimulatory receptor ligands in conjunction
with CARs was shown to increase the ability of human CD19 CAR-T cells to reject NALM6
leukemia xenografts in mice [32], suggesting that CAR signaling might beneﬁt from additional
costimulation in productively activated T cells.
CARs, TCRs, and BCRs
Both CARs and TCRs activate T cells and likely share many of the biophysical and biochemical
signaling events discussed above. However, CARs differ from TCRs in several prominent ways:
CARs harbor fewer subunits and fewer ITAMs, do not need coreceptors to support ligand
binding, have several-order higher afﬁnities for their targets, typically interface with much more
abundant cognate antigens, and can be activated by a molecularly diverse set of ligands
(Figure 3) [33]. In these aspects, CARs are actually more similar to B[536_TD$IF]-cell receptors (BCRs)
(Figure 3). The BCR extracellular domain consists of an antibody. Therefore, like CARs, BCRs
exhibit high ligand afﬁnity and recognize targets in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)unrestricted manner.
BCRs also share many of the signaling characteristics of TCRs, such as the phosphorylation of
ITAM motifs and the formation of receptor microclusters that mature into an immunological
synapse [34,35]. Notably, BCRs undergo tonic signaling, which is an emerging challenge in
CAR engineering efforts [10,11]. These shared themes in natural immunoreceptor signaling
may underlie the success of CARs in synthetically combining BCR and TCR properties to
activate T cells and trigger productive effector functions.

Predicting CAR Efﬁcacy in the Wet Lab
CAR-T cells are typically assessed for their therapeutic potential ﬁrst in vitro, then in mouse models,
and ﬁnally in Phase I clinical trials, with ﬁnancial and time commitments rising exponentially at each
transition. As such, there is a need for in vitro assays that can reliably identify promising CARs at
early stages of the bench-to-bedside pipeline. In vitro quantiﬁcations of cytokine production, T[571_TD$IF]-cell
proliferation, and target-cell lysis are the standard assays by which CARs are evaluated for basic
function. However, these assays often fail to predict relative in vivo performance when comparing
multiple CARs that demonstrate basic in vitro function [36].

Figure 2. An Integrated Mechanistic Model of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) Signaling Initiation. Research on T[532_TD$IF]-cell receptor (TCR) triggering and the speciﬁc
signaling domains utilized in CARs suggests that the following potential mechanisms work in concert to initiate CAR signaling. (A) Ligand binding could generate
mechanical forces that lead to the dissociation of CAR intracellular domains from the plasma membrane, thereby unmasking crucial binding sites for downstream
signaling molecules. (i) At rest, CAR intracellular domains (e.g., CD28 and CD3z) may interact with the plasma membrane, as they do in their native receptor contexts,
through basic residue motifs that bind to the negatively charged inner leaﬂet of the plasma membrane [14–16]. (ii) Upon antigen binding, CAR intracellular domains
dissociate from the plasma membrane and adopt a signaling-competent conformation that allows interactions with downstream signaling molecules, including kinases
such as ZAP-70 and LCK [15,16]. Phosphorylation of the intracellular domains is thought to lock the domains in the membrane-free state [15]. (B) Extending the receptor
deformation model of TCR triggering to CARs suggests that the changes in CAR conformation from (Ai) to (Aii) may arise from mechanical pulling or pushing between the
T cell and the target cell. (i) A pulling force can be transmitted via tension in the CAR extracellular and transmembrane domains to dislodge the intracellular domains from
the plasma membrane. (ii) A pushing force may alter the local membrane curvature, thereby reducing the stability of the membrane-associated state of the CAR
intracellular domains. (C) In the kinetic segregation model of TCR triggering, bulky phosphatases must be physically segregated from TCRs for T[532_TD$IF]-cell activation domains
to transduce signal. Thus, in addition to having accessible (i.e., membrane-free) intracellular signaling domains, CARs may also need to be segregated from
phosphatases to initiate signal transduction. (i) Segregation of phosphatases and CARs can occur when CAR/ligand interactions force the T cell and target cell into close
apposition and exclude bulky phosphatases from the immunological synapse (IS). (ii) By this logic, CARs with excessively long extracellular spacers that allow
phosphatases to comingle with CARs at the IS would not be able to robustly activate T[532_TD$IF]-cell signaling. (D) CARs in resting T cells are localized diffusely together with other
surface receptors such as CD45. As the events in (C) take place in response to target[618_TD$IF]-cell engagement, ligated CARs can coalesce into microclusters which have been
conﬁrmed to exclude CD45 and transduce T-cell activation signals [26]. With time, microclusters at the CAR-containing immunological synapse are hypothesized to
coalesce and organize with other native surface receptors into the supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC) that is commonly observed at TCR synapses.

To increase the predictive power of in vitro assays, stress tests have become an increasingly
common technique to mimic the repetitive stimulations and low effector-to-target ratios
characteristic of in vivo environments. For example, it has been shown that repeated challenges
with fresh tumor cells can reveal differences [56_TD$IF]across CAR-T cell lines in terms of their long-term

survival [36] and their propensities for PD[572_TD$IF]-1–mediated exhaustion [37] in ex vivo cultures, thus
providing a means to distinguish high-performing CARs from a pool of merely functional CARs.
An in vivo version of this stress test calls for rechallenging a mouse with an additional tumor load
once a previous tumor is cleared, and this method was used to demonstrate the superiority of
4-1BB over CD28 in the context of a mesothelin-speciﬁc CAR against mesothelioma xenografts [37]. In a similar vein, Sadelain and colleagues developed an in vivo stress test in which
mice were treated with serially reduced CAR-T cell doses to determine the lowest dose required
for a given CAR construct to achieve antitumor efﬁcacy [32]. Using this test[573_TD$IF], the researchers
compared six methods of providing CD28 and/or 4-1BB costimulation, and identiﬁed a rank
order of varying therapeutic efﬁcacies [32]. As these in vitro and in vivo approaches gain
credence in unmasking subtle differences in CAR therapeutic efﬁcacy, future work will be able
to assess additional ﬁne-tuned adjustments, such as variations [574_TD$IF]in dosing schedule and mixing
of various CAR-T cell products in treatment protocols.
Mouse models of CAR-T cell therapy typically employ immunocompromised mice to allow the
adoptive transfer of human T cells. Such systems differ sharply from the immune environment in
the eventual human therapeutic context, and they offer limited insight into how CAR-T cells may
interface with the endogenous immune components of the patient. However, the alternative[635_TD$IF]—
evaluating CARs in murine T cells adoptively transferred into immunocompetent mice[63_TD$IF]—comes
with the drawback that optimized murine CAR designs do not necessarily translate well to
human T[532_TD$IF]-cell performance. As with many other therapeutic modalities, the efﬁcacy of CAR-T
cell therapy in mouse models has not always translated to clinical success (e.g., ﬁrstgeneration CARs performed well in mice but consistently underperformed in clinical trials
[38–42]). Furthermore, the use of murine models prevents accurate evaluation of CAR

crossreactivity against healthy human tissues that might express the target antigen at low levels
[43]. The emerging methods described above are improving our ability to detect subtle
functional differences [57_TD$IF]across various CAR-T cell treatments. Nevertheless, deﬁnitive validation
of these methods will only come when future clinical trials are carried out to evaluate the
resulting conclusions.

Clinical Experiences and Challenges
The number of CAR-T cell therapy clinical trials has grown steadily since the turn of the century
(Box 2), with 147 clinical trials recruiting as of March 2017 according to www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Early clinical trials evaluated ﬁrst-generation CARs targeting several solid-tumor antigens,
including CD171 for neuroblastoma [39] [637_TD$IF], folate receptor (FR) for ovarian cancer [40], and
carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) for renal cell carcinoma [42]. These trials demonstrated the
feasibility of generating patient-speciﬁc T[532_TD$IF]-cell products, but they also highlighted important
challenges. First, no antitumor efﬁcacy was observed, and lack of CAR-T cell persistence after
adoptive transfer was cited as a major factor [39,40]. Furthermore, although anti-CD171 and
anti-FR CAR-T cells were well tolerated by patients, anti-CAIX CAR-T cells led to severe liver
toxicities associated with on- [638_TD$IF]target, off-tumor T-cell–mediated attacks on CAIX+[570_TD$IF] bile-duct
human epithelial cells [42]. Subsequent clinical trials incorporated changes in both antigen
target and CAR components such as additional costimulatory domains to address the challenges observed in these early clinical experiences.
CD19 CAR-T Cell Therapy for B[57_TD$IF]-cell Malignancies.
The most prominent CAR-T success story thus far has been the use of second- [639_TD$IF]generation
CARs targeting the pan[547_TD$IF]–B-cell marker CD19 [1–5]. In particular, CD19 CAR-T cell therapy has
achieved >85% complete response rate in the treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)
across multiple trials [44–46]. The success of CD19 CAR-T cell therapy has been attributed to
multiple factors. First, CD19 is highly expressed on the vast majority of malignant B cells, and
off-tumor toxicity is primarily limited to B[536_TD$IF]-cell aplasia, a condition that can be clinically
managed with prophylactic infusions of g-globulin [6] [62_TD$IF]. Second, the incorporation of costimulatory domains such as CD28 and 4-1BB has signiﬁcantly enhanced the potency of T[532_TD$IF]-cell
responses and survival upon adoptive transfer (Box 1) [47–51]. Third, liquid tumors such as
malignant B cells present a uniquely accessible environment for CAR-T cells, without several

Box 2. Clinician’s Corner
CARs are synthetic receptors that can be expressed in T cells to redirect T[624_TD$IF]- cell responses toward speciﬁc targets of
interest.
CARs that respond to the pan–B-cell marker CD19 have shown robust efﬁcacy in clinical trials for chemotherapyrefractory B[536_TD$IF]-cell malignancies, including lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In particular, multiple
trials have achieved >85% complete response rate in patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia.
Prominent side effects of CAR-T cell therapy observed in the clinic thus far include cytokine release syndrome (CRS,
characterized by sudden and dramatic spikes in serum cytokine levels); neurological toxicities (e.g., cerebral edema);
and on-target, off-tumor toxicities (e.g., T[532_TD$IF]-cell inﬁltration into healthy heart or lung tissues). Severe side effects have
contributed to cases of patient fatality in CAR-T cell trials targeting CD19 and HER2.
CAR-T cell therapy against non-hematologic malignancies has yielded limited success thus far. Potential obstacles
include inefﬁcient T[532_TD$IF]-cell localization to the tumor site, physical barriers to tumor inﬁltration by T cells, and potent
immunosuppressive factors that render T cells dysfunctional in the tumor microenvironment. Active preclinical research
and clinical trials are attempting to overcome obstacles in the application of CAR-T cells to other cancer types by
assessing different target antigens, treatment protocols, and methods to ‘armor’ the CAR-T cell.
In addition to cancer therapy, preclinical work has demonstrated the potential efﬁcacy of CAR-engineered T cells in
diverse therapeutic applications such as the control of viral infections and the treatment of autoimmune disorders.

immunosuppressive factors such as hypoxia and high local transforming growth factor (TGF)-b
activity that are typically associated with solid tumor microenvironments [52,53]. However,
despite these important advantages, clinical experience with CD19 CAR-T cell therapy has also
revealed ongoing challenges.
One important obstacle is the frequent occurrence of cytokine release syndrome (CRS, also
known as ‘cytokine storm[640_TD$IF]’)—the sudden and dramatic increase in serum levels of various
cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and
interferon (IFN)-g [44,46]. Cytokine production is an important T[532_TD$IF]-cell effector function that
appears to correlate with therapeutic efﬁcacy [54,55] [62_TD$IF]. However, severe CRS has also been
implicated in the death of multiple patients in CAR-T cell therapy trials [43,56]. Although the
administration of tocilizumab (an anti-IL-6 receptor a antibody), etanercept (a [641_TD$IF]TNF-a inhibitor),
or corticosteroids can often provide effective clinical intervention, these agents are not uniformly
effective across patients and, in the case of corticosteroids, can be lymphotoxic and directly
counter CAR-T cell therapy [57,58] [62_TD$IF]. This in turn can lead to relapses in patients that had
previously achieved complete remission [46]. Another challenge is that severe neurotoxicities
have been observed in multiple patients after CD19 CAR-T cell infusion, the cause of which
remains unclear [45,46,59]. A Phase II clinical trial conducted by Juno Therapeutics was halted
in July 2016 following the death of three patients from cerebral edema. The addition of the
chemotherapy drug ﬂudarabine to a lymphodepletion conditioning regimen that already
included cyclophosphamide was cited as the source of toxicity, and the US [579_TD$IF]FDA lifted the
clinical hold after 3 days. However, the same trial was suspended again in November 2016
following the deaths of two more patients as a result of cerebral edema. The cause of this
complication remains under investigation, and it is not yet certain whether this toxicity is unique
to CD19 CAR-T cell therapy. Finally, a sizable fraction of ALL patients who achieved complete
remission after CD19 CAR-T cell therapy eventually relapsed with the emergence of CD19
tumor cells [45,60]. It has been shown that antigen escape—escape of tumor cells from
immune surveillance as a result of loss of the targeted antigen—can be achieved by malignant B
cells via frameshift and missense mutations in CD19, as well as alternative splicing of the CD19
mRNA, each leading to the loss of binding epitopes recognized by CD19 CARs [61].
Despite these challenges, the clinical efﬁcacy of CD19 CAR-T cells has been remarkably
robust, and multiple companies are aiming for FDA approval of their CD19 CAR-T cell products
in 2017. As such, CD19 CAR-T cells will likely become the ﬁrst commercially available adoptive
T[532_TD$IF]-cell therapy for cancer. Beyond CD19, additional B[536_TD$IF]-cell malignancy antigens such as CD20,
CD22, and BCMA are also under active clinical investigation, highlighting exciting advancements in the treatment of refractory B[536_TD$IF]-cell leukemia and lymphoma.
CAR-T Cell Therapy for Non-Hematologic Malignancies
In contrast to the success observed in the treatment of B[536_TD$IF]-cell malignancies, clinical evaluations
of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors have yielded more-modest results. The majority of
completed clinical trials on solid tumors have utilized ﬁrst-generation CARs, and their limited
therapeutic efﬁcacies are perhaps unsurprising in retrospect [62]. However, trials with secondand third-generation CARs targeting the tumor-associated antigens mesothelin and HER2,
respectively, have also been completed, each revealing distinct challenges [43,63] [630_TD$IF].
Speciﬁcally, in a Phase I clinical trial, patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma or pancreatic
cancer were treated with T cells that had been transfected with mRNA encoding a secondgeneration mesothelin CAR containing a 4-1BB costimulatory domain [63,64] [62_TD$IF]. Transient,
partial response was observed in one patient [63], but the same patient eventually developed
anaphylaxis attributed to the generation of IgE antibodies speciﬁc to the CAR, which contained a murine scFv [64]. Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMAs) were detected in a second

patient among the group of four patients reported, highlighting the risk of immunogenicity
arising from CAR expression.
In a separate Phase I trial, a patient with metastatic colon cancer was treated with 1  1011[642_TD$IF]
CD8+ T cells expressing a third-generation HER2 CAR containing both CD28 and 4-1BB. The
patient experienced severe respiratory distress within 15 minutes of T- cell infusion and died of
cardiac arrest 5 days later [43]. Postmortem analysis conﬁrmed massive T[643_TD$IF]-cell inﬁltration into
the lung, and it was speculated that T-cell activation by low levels of HER2 expression on lung
epithelial cells triggered [580_TD$IF]severe CRS and contributed to patient mortality [43].
Although the path to solid tumor treatment with CAR-T cells has been littered with obstacles,
several ongoing clinical trials continue to evaluate multiple potential targets, including CEA for
colorectal cancers, disialoganglioside GD2 for neuroblastoma and sarcoma, prostate-speciﬁc
membrane antigen (PSMA) for prostate cancer and melanoma, epidermal growth factor
receptor variant three (EGFRvIII) and IL-13 receptor a2 (IL13Ra2) for glioblastoma, as well
as new trials targeting mesothelin and HER2 [62]. A recent report presented the case of a
patient with recurring multifocal glioblastoma who attained complete tumor resolution after
intraventricular infusion of IL13Ra2 CAR-T cells [65]. Remarkably, the CAR-T cells were able to
not only eliminate multiple intracranial tumors but also resolve spinal metastases. The patient
eventually relapsed 228 days after the ﬁrst CAR-T cell treatment, possibly due to decreased
expression of IL13Ra2 on tumor cells [65]. Nevertheless, such results provide evidence that
new antigens coupled with novel delivery modalities may lead to improved therapeutic outcomes against solid tumors. Indeed, new methods for local delivery of T cells to the tumor site[64_TD$IF]—
such as direct injection into the pleural cavity of the lung for pleural malignancies, or implantation of a T-cell–laden biopolymer at the site of surgical tumor resection—are active areas of
research [8,66] [645_TD$IF].

Current Pitfalls and Potential Remedies
Clinical experiences thus far highlight both the promise and the current limitations of CAR-T cell
therapy. Several different strategies are under active investigation to address the various
challenges that have been identiﬁed, with a general trend toward engineering multifunctional
T cells that enable greater control after T[532_TD$IF]-cell deployment into the patient.
Increasing Speciﬁcity
On-target, off-tumor toxicity has been a major challenge in CAR-T cell therapy, and its potential
lethality lends the problem particular urgency. Given a general lack of tumor- [64_TD$IF]exclusive surface
antigens, the vast majority of CARs are directed against tumor-associated antigens that are
also present on at least a subset of healthy cells. This shared antigen expression proﬁle is
responsible for off-tumor toxicities observed in CARs targeting CD19, HER2, and CEA, among
others [67]. Several cancer germline antigens (CGAs, also known as cancer testes antigens) are
being evaluated as potential targets, but it remains to be seen whether CGAs [647_TD$IF]that are widely
expressed on tumor cells but are absent from essential tissues can be identiﬁed [68]. An
alternative approach has focused on targeting ‘neoantigens[648_TD$IF]’—antigenic epitopes that arise
from tumor-speciﬁc somatic mutations and are thus unique to diseased (cancerous) cells [68].
Most neoantigen-targeted therapies have focused on the isolation of neoantigen-reactive T
cells and/or genes encoding the neoantigen-reactive TCR [69–71]. Nevertheless, mutations in
surface-bound receptors (e.g., EGFRvIII) are readily compatible with CAR-mediated targeting
[72], and it is also possible to engineer CARs to recognize MHC- [649_TD$IF]presented antigens [73,74].
Given the dearth of ‘perfect’ antigens that are both unique to and uniformly expressed on tumor
cells, researchers have actively explored alternative strategies to increase targeting speciﬁcity.
One approach is to ﬁne-tune the binding afﬁnity and avidity of CARs to identify a ‘sweet spot’

where the CAR could bind tumor cells harboring high antigen expression while sparing healthy
tissues with low antigen expression. By systematically examining mutations in EGFR- and
HER2- [650_TD$IF]binding scFv domains, researchers have generated CARs that could speciﬁcally target
glioma and ovarian carcinoma xenografts, respectively, while avoiding normal cells expressing
the same cognate antigen in mice [75,76]. The possibility of tuning the therapeutic window of
CAR-T cells by adjusting their ligand-binding afﬁnity and avidity has sustained clinical interest in
shared antigens such as HER2 and CEA despite past observations of severe toxicity [43,77].
Since 2012 a series of studies have explored the idea of increasing targeting speciﬁcity by
incorporating logical computation capabilities into CAR signaling [78–81]. By using Boolean
logic, AND- and NOT-gate CAR-T cells require that the target cells present the correct
‘combination’ of antigens (e.g., ‘A AND B,’ or ‘A but NOT B’) instead of a single antigen
before triggering T[651_TD$IF]-cell activation (Box 3 and Figure 4). Such strategies have the potential to
signiﬁcantly increase tumor-targeting speciﬁcity, generally at the cost of increasing complexity
in the transgenic constructs that must be introduced into the T[532_TD$IF]-cell product. It remains to be
seen whether these strategies would support robust therapeutic efﬁcacy in the clinical setting.
Preventing and Mitigating Toxicities
In addition to on-target, off-tumor toxicities, severe side effects such as CRS and neurotoxicity
have prompted a search for methods to prevent and manage toxicities. Dose reduction has
been considered as a general approach to reduce toxicity. For example, a high dose of T cells
(1  1011[532_TD$IF]) was used in the original HER2 CAR-T cell trial that led to patient death [43]. A
subsequent Phase I/II trial followed a dose-escalation protocol, starting with 1  104 cells and
ending at a maximum dose of 1  108 CAR-T cells [82]. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed
within the range tested, but efﬁcacy was also limited to a transient partial response in 1 of 17
evaluable patients. T-cell persistence correlated with T-cell dosage, suggesting that T-cell
dosing may need to operate within a limited window to support therapeutic efﬁcacy while
minimizing toxicity.
Another strategy for preventing or lessening toxicity is to reduce the longevity of CAR expression. Instead of virally integrating CAR-encoding genes into patient-derived T cells, transient
Box 3. Boolean Logic Computation to Increase CAR-T Cell Speciﬁcity
Tumor-targeting speciﬁcity of CAR-T cells can be increased by programming T cells to recognize combinations of
biomarkers instead of single antigens. Sadelain and colleagues demonstrated the NOT-gate concept by pairing a
conventional CAR or TCR with an inhibitory CAR (iCAR) that contains the signaling domains of CTLA-4 or PD-1. The
conventional CAR or TCR can trigger T[532_TD$IF]-cell activation upon binding to antigen A, but the presence of antigen B would
trigger an inhibitory cascade via the iCAR that overrides any activation signal, yielding ‘A but NOT B’ signal integration
([548_TD$IF]see Figure 4A in main text) [79].
Several AND-gate CAR designs have also been recently described. One design separates the CD3z and CD28/4-1BB
domains into two receptor chains targeting different antigens, such that full-intensity T[625_TD$IF]-cell activation can only be
achieved if both antigens are present to trigger both receptors (see Figure 4B in main text) [78]. In another approach,
Wang and colleagues designed a ‘masked CAR’ whose antigen-binding domain is blocked by a masking peptide which
can be removed by tumor-associated proteases in the tumor microenvironment ([50_TD$IF]see Figure 4C in main text) [81]. As a
further alternative, Lim and colleagues reported a novel ‘synNotch’ receptor [80] which releases a synthetic transcription
factor (TF) upon ligand binding to upregulate CAR expression from a cognate synthetic promoter ([51_TD$IF]see Figure 4D in main
text). The net effect is an AND-gate response in which antigen 1 triggers the synNotch receptor and CAR expression,
and a temporally delayed antigen 2 activates the T cell via CAR signaling. In principle, the synNotch platform can be
adapted to a wide range of ligand inputs and genetic outputs, but the use of various murine and viral components in this
system poses immunogenicity challenges.
It remains to be seen whether these highly engineered systems can achieve the robust T[532_TD$IF]-cell effector function and ﬁnetuned temporal resolution required to yield clinical efﬁcacy while preventing off-tumor toxicities. Answers to such
questions are anticipated in the near future as the ﬁeld of synthetic immunology moves beyond proof of concept into
more physiologically relevant systems.

Figure 4. Increasing Targeting Speciﬁcity of Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) by Boolean Logic Calculations. (A) NOT-gate CAR developed by the [537_TD$IF]Sadelain group
paired a conventional CAR or T cell receptor (TCR) with an inhibitory CAR (iCAR) that contains either PD-1 or CTLA-4. Antigen binding to the iCAR triggers an inhibitory
signal that overrides the activation signal from the conventional CAR or TCR [79]. (B–D) Three AND-gate CAR designs. (B) A chimeric costimulatory receptor (CCR) that
is equivalent to a third-generation CAR lacking the CD3z chain was developed. This CCR is paired with a ﬁrst-generation CAR, and both receptors must be triggered by
their respective cognate antigens to achieve full T[532_TD$IF]-cell activation [78]. (C) The [621_TD$IF]Wang group engineered a 'masked CAR' “masked CAR” whose antigen-binding domain is
blocked by a masking peptide until the peptide is removed via cleavage by a tumor- associated protease [81]. (D) The [539_TD$IF]Lim group developed a synNotch receptor that
releases a synthetic transcription factor (TF) upon ligand binding (signal 1). The TF subsequently drives the expression of a CAR from a synthetic cognate promoter, and
the CAR can then respond to its cognate antigen (signal 2) [80]. Abbreviations: Ag, antigen; cyto, cytoplasmic[540_TD$IF]; tm, transmembrane; scFv, single-chain variable fragment;

transfection of CAR-encoding mRNA can enable temporary CAR expression [63,83]. A major
trade-off associated with transient CAR expression is the need to infuse multiple doses of T
cells into each patient; indeed, repeated infusion is accompanied by an increased risk of
immune rejection of CAR-T cells, as illustrated by the previously discussed clinical trial targeting
mesothelin [64].
Taking a different approach, Lim and colleagues proposed a system in which a secondgeneration CAR is split into two chains that can be reconstituted into a functional receptor by
the dimerization-inducing molecule rapamycin or an analog [84]. Such a system enables
temporal control over the availability of functional CAR molecules via the use of the trigger
molecule, but the inability to spatially constrain the trigger molecule could limit its utility in
preventing off-tumor toxicity [84].
In lieu of toxicity prevention, strategies to rapidly eliminate CAR-T cells if and when patients
experience severe toxicity have also been proposed. Incorporation of herpes simplex virus
thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) into engineered cells allows their speciﬁc removal by the administration of ganciclovir [85,86]. However, immunogenicity associated with HSV-TK can lead to
rapid depletion of T cells expressing this transgene [87]. Another suicide strategy with clinical
promise is the inducible caspase 9 (iCasp9) protein, which dimerizes into a functional, proapoptotic form upon the addition of AP1903, a chemical inducer of dimerization [88]. A third
strategy is to express a truncated, non-ligand-binding, non-signaling copy of human EGFR

(huEGFRt) which allows selective depletion of huEGFRt+[652_TD$IF] T cells with the anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibody cetuximab [89]. Furthermore, the huEGFRt protein can simultaneously serve as a
marker for engineered T cells in cell sorting as well as in immunochemistry [4,5] [637_TD$IF], rendering it a
multipurpose addition to therapeutic CAR-T cells.
Increasing T[653_TD$IF]-Cell Persistence and Effector Function
Although toxicity management has been a major focus in CAR-T cell development, an equally
important challenge is generating T cells with sufﬁcient antitumor activities to achieve therapeutic efﬁcacy. Which starting T[532_TD$IF]-cell population is optimal for the generation of therapeutic
CAR-T cells remains an unresolved question [90]. Empirical evidence generated in non-CAR
adoptive T[532_TD$IF]-cell therapy models has variously supported the use of naïve [91], central memory
[92], and stem[586_TD$IF]-cell memory T cells [93]. Despite lack of deﬁnitive proof that any particular
T[532_TD$IF]-cell subtype is the optimal therapeutic candidate, an emerging consensus is that lessdifferentiated phenotypes are more likely to provide the proliferative potential required for
long-term engraftment, which is strongly correlated with superior therapeutic efﬁcacy
(Figure 5A) [68]. Recent work by Riddell and colleagues in a CD19 CAR mouse model identiﬁed
CD8+ central memory and CD4+ naïve T cell populations as being superior among naïve, central
memory, and effector memory compartments in eradicating lymphoma xenografts in mice [94].
Moreover, the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells subsets presented synergistic antitumor efﬁcacy when
combined [94]. These results informed the design of an ongoing clinical trial that uses CD19
CAR-T cells derived from deﬁned starting T-cell subsets (NCT01865617). The initial report of
the trial described 30 patients who received bulk CD4+[532_TD$IF] CAR-T cells mixed with CD8+ CAR-T
cells that were derived from either central-memory or bulk CD8+[587_TD$IF] T cells [95]. No statistically
signiﬁcant inferences could be made when contrasting the two CD8+ CAR-T cell groups, in part
due to large patient-to-patient variability in cell doses and lymphodepletion regimens, as well as
to the high overall remission rate regardless of the type of CD8+[58_TD$IF] CAR-T cells used (27 out of 29
evaluable patients achieved bone-marrow remission) [95]. However, the trial is ongoing and
may eventually provide sufﬁcient statistical power to identify superior T[532_TD$IF]-cell phenotypes in CART cell therapy.
Beyond choosing an appropriate starting population, the addition of transgenic features may
also enhance T[532_TD$IF]-cell persistence and effector function. The incorporation of costimulatory
molecules such as the 4-1BB ligand (4-1BBL) [32], cytokine receptors such as IL-7 receptor
a [96], and chemokine receptors such as CCR4 and CXCR2 [97,98] has been shown to
enhance the persistence, reduce the exhaustion, and increase the antitumor efﬁcacy of human
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure 5B). Another way to generate ‘armored’ CAR-T cells with
enhanced function involves the transgenic overexpression of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-12, and
IL-15, which promote T-cell proliferation and effector functions (Figure 5C) [99]. For example, it
has been reported that human CD4+[589_TD$IF] and CD8 +[654_TD$IF] T cells programmed to inducibly express IL-12
can enhance tumor rejection by resisting Treg-mediated inhibition [100]. However, the pleitropic effects of potent cytokines makes their transgenic overexpression a delicate balancing
act between therapeutic immune activation and pathologic overstimulation. For example, the
administration of T cells engineered to inducibly express IL-12 resulted in transient clinical
responses in multiple patients with metastatic melanoma, but at the cost of severe liver
toxicities [101].
The maintenance of T[532_TD$IF]-cell activation and effector function is regulated by an intricate balance
between stimulatory and inhibitory signals. Therefore, the negation of inhibitory signals can be
as effective as the promotion of activating signals in optimizing T[532_TD$IF]-cell function. For example,
both genetic and chemical approaches have been used to introduce inhibitors into human
CAR-T cells to counter the activity of tumor-associated immunosuppressive factors such as
adenosine, prostaglandin E2, and indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) metabolic products

Figure 5. Strategies to Enhance T[541_TD$IF]-Cell Persistence and Effector Function. Several engineering approaches have been
shown to increase T[532_TD$IF]-cell proliferation, persistence, and anti-tumor effector functions such as cytotoxicity and cytokine
production. These strategies include: (A) Using less differentiated cell types as starting material for chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR)-T cell manufacturing. (B) ‘Armoring’ CAR-T cells with additional transgenic receptors or receptor ligands
provide costimulation, enhance cytokine signaling, and/or promote migration [32,96–98]. (C) Equipping T cells with
stimulatory cytokines expressed from constitutive or inducible promoters (pNFAT, pEF1a) [99,163]. (D) Blocking inhibitory
signaling pathways through either the expression of transgenic peptides or the administration of pharmaceutical drugs
[102,103] [62_TD$IF]. (E) Generating chimeric receptors that either abolish endogenous signaling pathways or convert inhibitory
ligand inputs into stimulatory signal outputs [104,105,107–109]. Abbreviations: cyto, cytoplasmic; CCR4, C-C motif

(Figure 5D) [102,103]. In addition, studies on the adoptive transfer of both murine and human
tumor-targeting T cells have demonstrated that expression of a dominant negative TGF-b
receptor (DNR[65_TD$IF])—a truncated TGF-b receptor 2 chain that lacks the cytoplasmic signaling
domain[65_TD$IF]—can enhance the eradication of established tumors in both immunocompetent and
immunodeﬁcient mice (Figure 5E) [590_TD$IF][104,105,164]. The combination of the DNR with a HER2
CAR is currently under clinical evaluation (NCT00889954). Furthermore, inhibitory signals can
also be removed by genetic knockout of inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 [106], and this
strategy is now being evaluated in the clinic (NCT02793856).

Going one step further, fusion receptors that actively convert inhibitory ligand inputs to
stimulatory functional outputs have also been reported. Speciﬁcally, fusion proteins that
combine the extracellular ligand-binding domain of an inhibitory receptor (e.g., PD-1 or IL-4
receptor) with the cytoplasmic signaling domain of an immunostimulatory receptor (e.g., CD28,
IL-7, or IL-2/15bc receptor) have been shown to effectively rewire T[532_TD$IF]-cell responses to otherwise
inhibitory input signals (Figure 5E) [107–109]. The ability to maintain T[657_TD$IF]-cell persistence, sustain
antitumor effector functions, and prevent premature T-cell exhaustion will play a crucial role in
the development of robust therapeutic T cells for cancer immunotherapy.
Preventing Tumor Escape
Loss of antigen expression has been cited as the cause or potential cause of tumor relapse in
CAR-T cell therapy targeting CD19 and IL13Ra [45,60,65] [62_TD$IF]. Furthermore, tumor populations
are known to be highly heterogeneous and are characterized by considerable intratumor
variations in mutational proﬁles and gene[591_TD$IF]-expression signatures [110]; thus, a single CAR
may not be sufﬁcient to recognize all tumor clones in a given patient. To address the challenge
of antigen escape, we and others have developed bispeciﬁc CAR-T cells with a broadened
range of antigen recognition [30,111–114]. Three general strategies have been explored for the
generation of bispeciﬁc CAR-T cells: dual CAR (expressing two full-length CARs in each T cell),
pooled CAR (combining two T[532_TD$IF]- cell products, each expressing one CAR), and single-chain
bispeciﬁc CAR (expressing a single CAR molecule that can recognize two different antigens).
The dual-CAR and pooled-CAR strategies can readily make use of conventional, single-input
CAR constructs. However, the dual-CAR strategy must contend with either (i) the packaging
limit of viral vectors used to transduce T cells, with increasing payload size being strongly
correlated with decreasing transduction efﬁciency [115,116], or (ii) the toxicities and inefﬁciencies associated with multiple transductions steps required to introduce each CAR separately.
Although the pooled-CAR strategy avoids these drawbacks, it requires the generation of two
cell products for each patient, and only a portion of the infused cells will be able to recognize a
particular antigen. In a head-to-head comparison, the dual-CAR strategy has been shown to be
superior to the pooled-CAR approach [114] [630_TD$IF].
The generation of single-chain bispeciﬁc CARs requires structural optimization, and therefore a
potential increase in up-front cost at the receptor development stage compared to the other
two strategies [30]. However, once a bispeciﬁc CAR has been developed, the generation of
CAR-T cell products would beneﬁt from increased transduction efﬁciency or a lower number of
distinct cell products compared to the dual-CAR or pooled-CAR strategy, respectively.
Accumulating knowledge on the structure–function correlation in CAR designs will continue
to facilitate the development of novel CARs with increased functional capabilities.

Moving Beyond Artisanal T[532_TD$IF]-cell Production
To date, CAR-T cell therapy has been driven largely by academic centers that have developed
in-house expertise on the design, production, and administration of CAR-T cell products.
Although several companies have emerged in the wake of promising clinical reports, the
prospect of widespread application of CAR-T cell therapy hinges on the ability to move
T[532_TD$IF]-cell manufacturing toward robust and standardizable production processes. In its current
form, CAR-T cells are primarily a personalized medicine that must be tailor-made for each
patient. This individualization increases treatment costs and imposes a treatment-time delay
while new cell products are generated. Furthermore, standardization of product quality is
extremely difﬁcult because the starting material necessarily varies with individual patients.
Several ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the use of donor-derived T cells, with graftversus-host disease (GVHD) as the primary safety consideration [117]. Early clinical reports

indicate promising outcomes for the use of allogeneic CD19 CAR-T cells in the treatment of
patients who have received prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem[586_TD$IF]-cell transplants [118]. Efforts
toward the generation of ‘universal’ CAR-T cells have focused on eliminating the endogenous
TCR using gene-editing techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9, transcription activator-like effector
nucleases (TALENs), and zinc-ﬁnger nucleases (ZFNs) [106,119–122] [62_TD$IF]. Notably, two recent
studies introduced CAR transgenes into the TRAC locus to simultaneously yield CAR expression and eliminate native TCR activity [12,123]. Interestingly, expressing a CAR in the TRAC
locus yielded particularly potent CAR-T cells with reduced tonic signaling, terminal differentiation, and exhaustion [12]. In a ﬁrst- [658_TD$IF]in-human clinical application, TALEN-edited CD19 CAR-T
cells lacking the endogenous TCR a chain and CD52 (whose absence renders engineered T
cells insensitive to the lymphodepleting agent alemtuzumab) demonstrated clinical efﬁcacy in
the treatment of two infants with progressing ALL [124]. However, both patients also exhibited
symptoms of skin GVHD that were attributed to the presence of residual TCR+ donor T cells,
highlighting room for further improvement [124] . Instead of eliminating the endogenous TCR,
an alternative strategy is to integrate the CAR into a starting T[532_TD$IF]-cell population with known TCR
speciﬁcity, particularly toward Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) – which can be found in the majority of
the human population in the form of latent infection [125–128]. The use of T cells with a known
TCR speciﬁcity reduces the risk of unexpected off-tumor toxicities. Furthermore, it has been
proposed that generating CAR-T cells from EBV-speciﬁc T cells can enhance productive T[532_TD$IF]-cell
activation through costimulatory signals provided by latently infected antigen-presenting cells in
vivo [125–127]. GD2 CARs integrated into EBV-speciﬁc T cells are currently being evaluated in
the clinic for the treatment of GD2+[62_TD$IF] sarcomas (NCT01953900).

Better Together: Prospects of Combination Therapy
CAR-T cell therapy is one of several new advances in immunotherapy in recent years, and the
prospect of combining different treatment modalities has been under active evaluation. Current
protocols for adoptive T[532_TD$IF]-cell transfer typically include conditioning chemotherapy, which
enhances antitumor efﬁcacy by depleting endogenous lymphocytes (including Tregs), and
maximizing homeostatic proliferative support for transferred T cells [1,90,129]. In the case of
patients with B[659_TD$IF]-cell malignancies, conditioning chemotherapy may also reduce disease burden, which can further enhance T-cell proliferation and persistence [1]. More recently, synergistic possibilities between CAR-T cell therapy and checkpoint blockade have become a
topic of great interest [37,130,131]. Because T[60_TD$IF]-cell exhaustion has been cited as a primary
cause of failures in T-cell–mediated anti-tumor immunity [132–135], combination therapies that
support sustained T[532_TD$IF]-cell effector function have the potential to signiﬁcantly improve treatment
outcomes. Indeed, a recent clinical report suggests that PD-1 blockade can enhance the
antitumor efﬁcacy of CD19 CAR-T cells in patients who fail to respond to CD19 CAR-T cells
alone, although additional studies will be necessary to elucidate detailed mechanisms behind
the observed therapeutic synergy [136] [61_TD$IF].

Diverse Therapeutic Applications
Beyond cancer therapy, efforts have also been underway to use CARs to combat infectious
and autoimmune diseases in preclinical models. Antiviral approaches have targeted hepatitis B
[137], hepatitis C [138], and HIV [139,140] infections, where virus-infected cells can be
distinguished by surface presentation of speciﬁc viral proteins. An antifungal CAR uses the
extracellular domain of the pattern- [62_TD$IF]recognition receptor dectin-1 as its antigen-binding
domain and effectively targets carbohydrate epitopes on the opportunistic fungus Apergillus,
disrupting its germination [141]. The dectin-1 CAR demonstrates that pattern-recognition
receptors from the innate immune system may serve as a source of antigen-binding domains
for CARs that target pathogens.

A recent study demonstrated the novel use of CAR-T cells against the antibody-mediated
autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV) [26] [62_TD$IF]. This strategy takes advantage of the fact
that PV pathology is largely attributed to a single cellular source[63_TD$IF]—pathogenic, anti-Dsg3
antibody–expressing memory B cells—whose surface marker can be recognized by CARs
[26]. CAR-T cells have also been engineered to attack autoreactive T cells, including both CD4+
and CD8+ targets. Speciﬁcally, these CARs utilize an MHC-I or MHC-II/autoantigenic peptide
complex as their extracellular domain, which enables ligation with autoreactive TCRs on target
T cells [142,143]. Intriguingly, such redirected T cells were reported to ameliorate experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, a murine model of multiple sclerosis) by inhibiting the
activity of multiple autoreactive T cell clones, including those whose cognate epitopes were
different from that targeted by the CAR-T cells [142]. Furthermore, the pathologic type 1 T
helper (Th1)- dominant responses to autoantigens were replaced by protective type 2 T helper
responses after CAR-T cell treatment, suggesting a true reprogramming of the immune
response mediated by adoptively transferred T cells [142].
The potent immunosuppressive capabilities of Tregs have also been harnessed with CAR
engineering to address therapeutic approaches for autoimmune diseases. For instance, Tregs
engineered with the aforementioned CARs can recognize autoreactive TCRs and both prevent
and treat EAE in mice [144]. In cases where autoreactive immune cells cannot be identiﬁed or
do not exist, CARs can direct Treg activity to the site of inﬂammation[65_TD$IF]—such as the brain (in the
case of EAE) [145] or the colon (in the case of murine colitis) [146][6_TD$IF]—to attenuate local
inﬂammatory activity. Furthermore, human CAR-Tregs with engineered speciﬁcity to [67_TD$IF]the human
major histocompatibility complex HLA-A2 have been shown to both attenuate GVHD caused
by adoptively transferred HLA-A2+[64_TD$IF] peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and
minimize rejection of HLA-A2+ human PBMCs and skin tissues in mice [147–149]. In addition,
Tregs engineered with CARs that bind to factor VIII (FVIII, a blood-clotting protein used as
replacement therapy in hemophilia A patients) were found to suppress the production of antiFVIII antibodies and reduce the proliferation of FVIII- reactive T cells in vitro [150], thus returning
tolerance for the FVIII clotting factor. Taken together, these results suggest that CAR Tregs
might be used to promote tolerance in the host to autoimmunogenic stimuli, allogeneic tissues,
and allergens.

Concluding Remarks
The clinical success of CD19 CAR-T cells has inspired tremendous interest in adoptive T[69_TD$IF]-cell
therapy in recent years. Accumulating knowledge on T-cell biology, CAR signaling, and rational
protein engineering promises to support the continuing improvement of CAR-T cell therapy for
applications in cancer and beyond. Novel engineering strategies that produce T cells with
increasingly complex functionalities have been developed to address issues such as tumortargeting speciﬁcity and longevity of T[532_TD$IF]-cell response in vivo, and a major task facing the ﬁeld is
the transition from proof-of-concept studies to the development of clinically implementable
technologies. Although imperfect, preclinical mouse models have been successfully used to
identify an arsenal of strategies to improve CAR-T cell efﬁcacy against immunosuppressed solid
tumors; future work must identify which strategies or combinations of strategies will hold true in
the human clinical context. As CAR-T therapy advances through clinical trials toward widespread application, a signiﬁcant number of important questions remain to be answered (see
Outstanding Questions). Nevertheless, as a highly programmable, living immunotherapeutic
strategy, CAR-T cells are poised to provide an alternative treatment paradigm for a variety of
diseases still awaiting effective treatment options.

Outstanding Questions
Which antigens can serve as effective
and non-toxic targets for non[598_TD$IF]–B-cell
malignancies? Antigens that facilitate
effective tumor elimination while avoiding off-tumor toxicities remain elusive.
The ability to identify better antigens for
safe and efﬁcacious tumor targeting
will widen the applicability of adoptive
T[532_TD$IF]-cell therapy for cancer.
How can we overcome challenges
associated with solid tumors[670_TD$IF]—including antigen choice, immune suppression, access to ‘cold’ tumors that lack
inﬂammatory signatures, and inﬁltration into solid tumor masses? Multiple
factors surrounding tumor access and
maintenance of T[532_TD$IF]-cell functionality
within tumor microenvironments will
need to be addressed to increase therapeutic efﬁcacy against solid tumors.
How can we achieve high-throughput
optimization of new CAR constructs
with predictable in vivo functionality?
CAR engineering has relied on laborintensive and time-consuming in vitro
characterizations that often fail to predict in vivo functionality. The identiﬁcation of in vitro assays with higher
predictive value, and the development
of higher-throughput T[532_TD$IF]-cell isolation,
expansion, and characterization methods, will facilitate the generation of
novel CARs for new disease targets.
How can we develop widely accessible
T[532_TD$IF]-cell manufacturing processes that
can generate high-quality T[532_TD$IF]-cell products? Current knowledge on T[532_TD$IF]-cell
manufacturing is concentrated in a
few academic centers and companies
afﬁliated with such centers. Widespread application of T[671_TD$IF]-cell therapy will
necessitate the development of robust
T-cell manufacturing processes that
can be consistently replicated in nonspecialist medical centers.
Could we generate donor-derived ‘universal CAR-T cells’ that can be premanufactured for off-the-shelf use?
The personalized nature of current
CAR-T cell therapy increases treatment cost and limits its availability.
Off-the-shelf CAR-T cells would significantly broaden the accessibility of this
treatment paradigm.
