Abstract
Introduction: To compare percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ﬂexible ureterorenoscopy for
treating kidney stones between 2 and 3 cm.
Material and methods: A prospective, comparative, nonrandomised study was conducted with
108 patients with kidney stones between 2 and 3 cm. Fifty-four patients underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy and 54 underwent ﬂexible ureteroscopy. We compared the following
variables: lithiasis-free rate (%), surgical time, the need for an auxiliary process, postoperative
complications, hospital stay, readmission rates and recovery time.
Results: There were no differences in the lithiasis-free rate between the 2 surgical techniques
(76% for ureteroscopy vs. 87% for nephrolithotomy; p = 0.1) or in the complications (29% for
nephrolithotomy vs. 27% for ureteroscopy; p = 0.4). A larger number of auxiliary process were
needed for the ureteroscopy group (20%) than for the nephrolithotomy group (7%) (p = 0.04).
The surgical time was longer for the nephrolithotomy group (121 ± 52 min) than for the
ureteroscopy group (93 ± 42 min) (p = 0.004).
The ureteroscopy group had shorter hospital stays (2.1 ± 1.6 vs. 3.9 ± 1.9 days; p = 0.002),
shorter convalescence (8.1 ± 4.9 vs. 13.3 ± 4.2 days; p = 0.005) and higher readmission rates
(7.4% vs. 0%, p = 0.05) than the nephrolithotomy group.
Conclusions: Nephrolithotomy and ureteroscopy have similar efﬁcacy for treating kidney stones
measuring 2---3 cm, with no differences in complications.
Ureteroscopy results in shorter hospital stays, quicker recoveries but more readmissions and
a greater need for auxiliary procedures.

requerimiento de proceso auxiliar, complicaciones postoperatorias, estancia hospitalaria, tasas
de reingreso y tiempo de recuperación.
Resultados: No existieron diferencias en la tasa libre de litiasis entre ambas técnicas quirúrgicas
(76% ureteroscopia, 87% nefrolitotomía) (p = 0,1), ni en las complicaciones (nefrolitotomía: 29%;
ureteroscopia: 27%; p = 0,4). Se ha requerido mayor número de procesos auxiliares en el grupo
de ureteroscopia (20%) frente al de nefrolitotomía (7%) (p = 0,04).
El tiempo quirúrgico fue más largo en el grupo de nefrolitotomía (121 ± 52 min) que en el
grupo de ureteroscopia (93 ± 42 min) (p = 0,004).
El grupo de ureteroscopia tuvo menor estancia hospitalaria (2,1 ± 1,6 vs. 3,9 ± 1,9 días,
p = 0,002), menor convalecencia (8,1 ± 4,9 vs. 13,3 ± 4,2 días, p = 0,005) y mayores tasas de
reingreso (7,4% vs. 0%, p = 0,05) que el grupo de nefrolitotomía.
Conclusiones: La nefrolitotomía y la ureteroscopia tienen una eﬁcacia similar para el
tratamiento de la litiasis renal entre 2---3 cm, sin diferencias en las complicaciones.
La ureteroscopia tiene menor estancia hospitalaria, una recuperación más rápida pero mayor
reingreso y necesidad de procedimiento auxiliar.

Introduction
European guidelines updated as of 2015 recommend percutaneous surgery (PCNL) and ﬂexible ureterorenoscopy
(F-URS) as treatments of choice for calculi of 1---2 cm in
the lower calyx, with unfavorable factors for extracorporeal lithotripsy. PCNL is considered the technique of choice
for the treatment of renal lithiasis > 2 cm.1,2 Although PCNL
is highly effective, it continues to have a non-negligible
morbidity.3,4 . The technological advances applied to ﬂexible endoscopy allow F-URS to be a valid alternative for the
treatment of larger renal lithiasis,5---11 with few comparative
studies between the two techniques.12,13
The main objective of this study was to compare
the efﬁcacy (stone free rate %) of both surgical techniques. The secondary objectives were to analyze and
compare complications, surgical time, ancillary process
requirements, readmission rates, hospital stay, and recovery
time.

Material and methods
Between January 2013 and December 2015 we performed an
observational, prospective, comparative, non-randomized
study of 108 patients with symptomatic renal lithiasis
between 2 and 3 cm.
Inclusion criteria were any patient with single or multiple
symptomatic renal lithiasis (pain, infection or hematuria)
between 2 and 3 cm. Exclusion criteria were single kidney patients, with known kidney failure and previously

diagnosed anatomical alterations (pyelo-ureteral stenosis,
calyceal diverticula). Patients were explained the possibility
of both treatments, with the known advantages and disadvantages of both, and according to their opinion, and under
medical criteria, they were performed one technique or the
other. All patients sign an informed medical consent. Assuming a stone free rate of 80% with RIRS, and about 100%
with PCNL, the sample size was calculated at least at 35
patients per group, assuming a type 1 error of 5%. Finally,
54 patients underwent PCNL and 54 patients underwent
F-URS.
All patients underwent a clinical evaluation that included
a complete medical history with anamnesis and physical examination, routine laboratory tests (baseline serum
parameters including complete blood count, coagulation,
biochemistry) and an anesthetic risk assessment according
to the American Anesthesiology Association (ASA). A sediment and urine culture was collected one week before the
surgery. Patients with positive culture were treated with
antibiotic between 5 and 7 days before the surgery, the
rest were treated with 1.5 g ev of cefuroxime in anesthetic
induction. All patients were evaluated preoperatively with
abdominal CT scan.
The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the
patients (sex, age, body mass index, Charlson morbidity index), as well as the data of the lithiasis (number,
location, uni/multiplicity, size) were collected and compared (Table 1). The size of the stone was measured
as the largest diameter. In cases of multiple lithiasis, it
was deﬁned as the sum of the largest diameters of each
lithiasis.

Surgical technique
Technique of percutaneous nephrolithotomy
Patient in Valdivia position modiﬁed according to
Galdakao.14,15 Under general anesthesia, placement of
a 6 Fch ureteral catheter up to the renal pelvis was performed by means of urethro-cystoscopy. Subsequently,
opaciﬁcation of the urinary tract and puncture of renal
cavities with a remote-controlled 18 G needle were performed. In most cases, a high-pressure balloon path dilation
was performed up to 24 Fch, or with progressive metallic
dilators telescoped according to Alken’s technique, leaving
24 Fch Amplatz sheath. Storz nephroscope was used without
the outer sheath, and lithotripsy was performed with
ultrasonic energy (Olympus). At the end of the procedure,
a 20 Fch nephrostomy tube was left on the way to the renal
cavities. The surgical time was calculated from the beginning of the urethrocystoscopy until the placement of the
nephrostomy.
Flexible ureterorenoscopy technique
It was performed with the patient of lithotomy and under
general anesthesia. A semi-rigid transurethral ureteroscope
passage was performed up to the bladder access, a safety
guidewire was placed up to the renal cavities, a semi-rigid
ureteroscopy was performed up to the kidney to check the
ureter status and to perform a controlled dilation of it.
Subsequently, ureteral access sheath 11/13 to 13/15 Fch
(Navigator-Boston) was placed to the pyeloureteral junction, and a ﬂexible digital ureteroscope (Olympus or Storz)
was passed. Lithotripsy was performed with 270 ␮m ﬁber of
Dornier Holmium laser, for multifragmentation-vaporization
with an energy in the range of 0.4---0.8 J at a frequency of
800---1200 Hz. At the end of the procedure, all the calyceal
groups were inspected to conﬁrm adequate fragmentation.
In all cases we left a 6 Fch JJ renovesical catheter, which
was removed on an outpatient basis after 7---10 days if there

0.6

are no complications. The surgical time was calculated from
the beginning of the ureteroscopy until the placement of the
JJ renovesical catheter.
The efﬁcacy of the surgical technique (% stone free rate)
was evaluated at the third postoperative month with the
performance of a simple abdominal Rx and a kidney and
bladder ultrasound. It was considered clean of lithiasis when
there is no evidence of lithiasic remains or they are <4 mm.16
Those patients with symptomatic residual lithiasis undergo
a second procedure that was counted and evaluated as an
auxiliary process requirement.
Complications were recorded according to the modiﬁed
Clavien-Dindo classiﬁcation.17
Convalescence time was considered the time that elapses
from the time when the patient is operated until he resumes
his usual physical activity, allowing him to carry out his usual
professional activity.
To analyze the results, we used the statistical program
SPSS 13.0. When the distribution of numerical variables was
normal, Student’s ‘t’-test for mean comparison was used.
The Chi square test was used to analyze the proportions of
categorical variables. Statistically signiﬁcant difference was
considered when p was less than or equal to 0.05.

Results
The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the
patients (sex, age, body mass index, Charlson’s morbidity
index), as well as the characteristics of the lithiasis (number,
location, size, and uni/multiplicity), were similar in both
groups, without signiﬁcant differences (Table 1).
The stone-free rate was lower in the RIRS group (76%)
than in the PCNL group (87%), with no signiﬁcant differences (p = 0.1). At 3 months, and taking into account the
need for a second procedure, the stone-free rates were
similar in the RIRS (85%) and PCNL (87%) group (p = 0.5). A

signiﬁcantly higher percentage of second procedures was
required due to symptomatic remains in the RIRS group
(20%) versus PCNL (7%) (p = 0.04). The RIRS group needed in
4 patients rigid ureteroscopy, in 5 patients extracorporeal
shock wave lithotripsy, in one patient urinary diversion with
a new JJ catheter, and in another one with nephrostomy.
A rigid ureteroscopy, an extracorporeal lithotripsy, and 2
ureteral JJ catheterizations were required in the PCNL group
(Table 2).
The complications of both surgical techniques were similar according to the Clavien-Dindo classiﬁcation, with no
signiﬁcant differences between the two groups (p = 0.4).
There were 29% of complications in the PCNL group, all
being lower than Clavien 3 (10% Clavien 1, 11% Clavien 2
and 8% Clavien 3). We observed 27% of complications in the
F-URS group, all being inferior to Clavien 3 (13% Clavien 1,
4% Clavien 2, and 10% Clavien 3). 15 complications were
observed in the PCNL group: 5 grade 1 complications (4 urinary infections, 1 hematuria), 6 grade 2 complications (4
transfusion, 2 prolonged fevers), 4 grade 3 complications
(1 renovesical JJ catheterization due to urinary ﬁstula,
2 renovesical JJ catheterizations due to renal colic, 1
embolization due to persistent hematuria), and no complication greater than 3. We observed 14 complications in the
RIRS group: 7 grade 1 complications (6 hematurias and 1 urinary infection), 2 grade 2 complications (prolonged fever),
5 grade 3 complications (4 renovesical JJ catheterizations
per renal colic and 1 percutaneous renal abscess puncture)
and no major grade 3 complications.
Surgical time (mean ± SD) was signiﬁcantly longer in
the PCNL group (121 ± 52 min) than in the RIRS group
(93 ± 42 min) (p = 0.004).
The RIRS group had a shorter hospital stay (mean ± SD)
(2.1 ± 1.6 vs. 3.9 ± 1.9 days, p = 0.002) and a shorter period
of convalescence (mean ± SD) (8.1 ± 4.9 vs. 13.3 ± 2.4 days,
p = 0.005) than PCNL.
There were signiﬁcantly higher re-admission rates in the
RIRS group (7.4%) than in the PCNL group (0%) (p = 0.05).
Although we have not been able to obtain the analysis
of the calculi in all cases, we can observe how there are no
differences in the type of calculi analyzed in relation to the
technique performed (Table 3).

Discussion
According to the European guidelines, the technique of
choice for renal lithiasis greater than 2 cm is PCNL, without
specifying which one (standard, mini PCNL, ultramini PCNL,
or micro PCNL), and that there is an increasing tendency
to perform less invasive techniques, using smaller calibres,
thus reducing morbidity.18 However, studies comparing miniPCNL vs RIRS indicate similar results (lithiasis-free rate) with
the same complication rate (postoperative stay, analgesic
requirement). The latest publications19---22 indicate better
results with mini PCNL in average size (1.5---2 cm) lower than
ours. When sizes are >2 cm, the results are matched with
longer hospital stay for mini PCNL.23,24 Therefore, in our
study, facing more complex cases (2.5 cm mean size, 50%
multiplicity), we compared the results to standard PCNL
(24 Fch), and because the applicable ultrasonic lithotripsy
in standard PCNL enables aspiration of fragments. But
undoubtedly, mini PCNL alone or combined with RIRS is
an attractive alternative, since it makes it possible to add
the advantages of both techniques with less morbidity. It
remains to be determined which group of patients will be
the best candidates, probably those in whom RIRS alone is
less effective (hard lithiasis, multiple between 2 and 2.5 cm
and of more difﬁcult retrograde access).
Most of the authors who have compared the efﬁcacy of
both treatments in renal lithiasis ≥2 cm agree that in a single
procedure the efﬁcacy is higher with PCNL. However, these
differences disappear if we take into account the repetition of the procedure10,12,21,23,25 (Table 4). We have obtained
these same results. At 3 months, we veriﬁed that the

efﬁcacy of both techniques is similar, although with F-URS
we need more procedures due to greater symptomatic residual lithiasis, which is also reﬂected in a higher re-admission
rate. In a not very far away future, improvements in lasers
(improvement in vaporization, aspiration systems) and the
combination of less invasive anterograde-retrograde techniques (smaller caliber of endoscopes) probably allow us to
reduce this residual rate.
The 2 studies most similar to ours obtain similar efﬁcacy
ﬁgures for both techniques, 90% and 94% for PCNL, and 75%
for F-URS. Unlike our series, in which 50% of patients had
multiple lithiasis, Akman et al. only treated 25% of patients
with multiple lithiasis, and in the series by Bryniarski et al.
they were unique and pyelic lithiases. All of that makes the
groups not entirely comparable.12,13
Evaluating surgical time comparatively, we observed
longer surgical time in the PCNL group, as did Bryniarsky
et al.13 However, Akman et al. found longer surgical time
in the F-URS group on PCNL. These studies do not clearly
describe how they count operative time. Many factors can
inﬂuence the time used as the position of the patient, the
source and power of energy used in lithotripsy, the technique used (vaporization or fragmentation-extraction). All
these factors make comparative analyses difﬁcult.
One of the theoretical advantages of F-URS on PCNL is the
need for shorter hospital stay, lower analgesic requirements
and, therefore, a faster recovery period. The majority of
authors agree to point out that the hospital stay is shorter
with F-URS,11,12 an aspect that we have also seen clearly
in our study. Other authors have described lower analgesic
requirements as an advantage of F-URS over PCNL.13 We have
not found in the literature any study that mentions, as a
consequence of all the above, that these advantages translate into a shorter time of convalescence or recovery. In our

series we can conﬁrm a signiﬁcantly lower convalescence
time with F-URS. This aspect is interesting if we take into
account that the majority of the lithiasic population is active
in terms of work, so we believe that it should be explained
to the patients when deciding the treatment.
Few studies have compared the complications of both
surgical techniques using the Clavien Dindo classiﬁcation
and have found no differences.27 Nor do we ﬁnd differences using Clavien Dindo classiﬁcation.17 29% and 27% of
the patients had some complications in the PCNL and FURS groups respectively, the majority of them being low
grade. In a more voluminous series than ours, on lithiases
larger than 2 cm treated with F-URS, Giusti et al. obtain
25% of complications.26 Similar ﬁgures of complications can
be observed with PCNL. Thus, Seitz et al. report 26%, the
majority being low grade.27 These data suggest that overall
there are no differences in the rates of complications or in
the severity of them.
The limitation of this study, despite being observational and prospective, is the lack of randomization of the
patients, although we did not observe differences in any
of the variables analyzed in both groups (Tables 1 and 3).
Another limitation of the study is the evaluation of results
with simple Rx and ultrasound. Undoubtedly, the performance of a CT, if possible of low radiation, would have
been a more complete evaluation. Another limitation of
the study is to have considered fragments <4 mm as free
from lithiasis. We can intuit that the evolution of the
fragments of laserthripsy will be the same as after extracorporeal lithotripsy, 20% of the residual fragments <5 mm
will have symptoms in a period of 5 years.28 However,
most authors still consider this size with high chances of
spontaneous expulsion, and therefore considered free of
lithiasis.16,29

Comparative: percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ﬂexible ureteroscopy in kidney stones
As a general conclusion, we can afﬁrm that in the absence
of comparative prospective randomized studies in patients
with multiple lithiasis and of size between 2 and 3 cm, F-URS
is an alternative technique to PCNL with a similar efﬁcacy
and complication rate, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery,
and shorter surgical time. In contrast, F-URS has higher readmission rates and requires a greater number of ancillary
procedures.
