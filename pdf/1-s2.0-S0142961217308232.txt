Peritoneal metastasis is a major cause of death and preclinical models are urgently needed to enhance
therapeutic progress. This study reports on a hybrid hydrogel-polylactic acid (PLA) scaffold that mimics
the architecture of peritoneal metastases at the qualitative, quantitative and spatial level. Porous PLA
scaffolds with controllable pore size, geometry and surface properties are functionalized by type I
collagen hydrogel. Co-seeding of cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAF) increases cancer cell adhesion, recovery and exponential growth by in situ heterocellular spheroid formation. Scaffold implantation into
the peritoneum allows long-term follow-up (>14 weeks) and results in a time-dependent increase in
vascularization, which correlates with cancer cell colonization in vivo. CAF, endothelial cells, macrophages and cancer cells show spatial and quantitative aspects as similarly observed in patient-derived
peritoneal metastases. CAF provide long-term secretion of complementary paracrine factors implicated
in spheroid formation in vitro as well as in recruitment and organization of host cells in vivo. In
conclusion, the multifaceted heterocellular interactions that occur within peritoneal metastases are
reproduced in this tissue-engineered implantable scaffold model.

cancer are common and are increasingly regarded as a treatable
locoregional progression of disease, rather than a manifestation of
systemic disease. This new insight resurged an interest in intraperitoneal chemotherapy after surgical cytoreduction [1]. Since
reintroduction of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, there is a trend
toward long-term survival and even disease cure, with reported 5year survival rates as high as 50% [2,3]. Although intraperitoneal

chemotherapy has encouraging efﬁcacy, its major limiting factor is
the very poor tissue penetration. Accordingly, there is limited survival beneﬁt from intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients with
residual tumor nodules exceeding the size of 5.0 mm for ovarian
cancer and 2.5 mm for colorectal cancer [4,5]. Another important
point to be emphasized is that the peritoneal tumor microenvironment, mainly composed of cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (CAF)
and their extracellular matrix, also contributes to therapy resistance by inducing interstitial hypertension and scavenging
chemotherapy, among others [6,7]. To further improve intraperitoneal chemotherapy's potential, preclinical peritoneal metastasis
models should more closely mimic the tumor microenvironment of
bulky residual disease (>5.0 mm, ±100 mm3).
Several xenograft models are currently used to model peritoneal
metastases and can be grouped into three categories [8]. 1) The
intraperitoneal injection of suspended cancer cells (cancer cell line
or patient-derived) into the abdominal cavity has been a useful and
widely used tool to establish peritoneal metastases. For some
cancer cell lines, this procedure yields high tumor take and
dissemination rates and permits fast tumor growth, and as such,
replicates peritoneal metastases in patients quite well macroscopically. The countless tumor nodules are ideally suited to study the
processes of peritoneal dissemination, but their size is considered
too small (<1 mm) to be relevant for intraperitoneal drug applications for bulky residual disease [9e11]. 2) In contrast, the subperitoneal injection of cancer cells initiates a single, localized, large
tumor nodule (due to controlled cancer cell transfer), whereas
additional peritoneal metastases occur rarely or not at all. This
technique, however, should be regarded as an ectopic model where
the metastasis is established at the wrong side of the peritoneal
layer and is not directly exposed to the abdominal cavity [12,13]. 3)
In a tumor transplant model, human cancer cells are subcutaneously injected into a donor mouse. Once the tumor grows to an
appropriate size, it is engrafted orthotopically into the abdominal
cavity of another host animal (acceptor) [14]. A disadvantage of this
model is that the transplant tumor generally fails both to elicit an
efﬁcient inﬁltration of blood vessels and to initiate vascular anastomoses between graft and recipient blood vessels.
While much has been learned with the aforementioned models,
they do not fully recapitulate what is observed in the cognate
peritoneal metastasis microenvironment. In fact e in these xenografts e the bulk of tumor comprises only cancer cells, while CAF,
extracellular matrix, immune cells and blood vessels are only a
minor component of the mass. Obviously, the presence of a suitable
microenvironment is considered to be important to assess tumor
response to intraperitoneal (or intravenous) chemotherapy [15].
Continued development in the ﬁelds of cancer systems biology, 3D
modeling, biomaterials and tissue engineering provides new opportunities to design more patient-relevant metastasis models. For
instance, tissue engineering of the pre-metastatic niche [16] and
bone metastases [17] has been successful but e to the best of our
knowledge e no attempts have yet been made to engineer a biomimetic of a peritoneal metastasis that can provide an advanced
technology platform for both in vitro and in vivo experiments.
The present work aimed to employ hybrid hydrogel-polylactic
acid (PLA) scaffolds to combine the advantages of both (bio)materials and to overcome the challenges discussed above, including
size and geometry requirements, participation of the tumor
microenvironment, efﬁcient engraftment and successful cell colonization. 3D printing enables fabrication of scaffolds e “peritoneal
metastases” e of practically any desired dimension and geometry.
Above all, scaffolds are highly porous, which permits cellular
inﬁltration and ensures interaction with host tissue, including
angiogenesis and inﬂammation, both of which are important to
metastasis and drug resistance [18]. The rigid and mechanical

stable nature of the PLA scaffolds allows implantation into the
peritoneum of an appropriate host animal. PLA is considered to be
biocompatible, but both biochemical surface modiﬁcation by gelMOD coating and the employment of a type I collagen hydrogel
provide a more matrix- and cell-interactive nature to the construct.
Another key point is that CAF are drivers of peritoneal metastasis
[19]; the addition of CAF to cancer cells in a type I collagen hydrogel
stimulated cancer cell growth and invasion in ovarian and colorectal cancer models [19,20].
In summary, we examined the potential of hybrid hydrogel-PLA
scaffolds and CAF to support the in vitro engineering of the tumor
microenvironment of bulky peritoneal metastases and the subsequent implantation of this tissue-engineered construct to serve as
an in vivo technology platform for intraperitoneal xenografts.

2. Methods
2.1. Scaffold development
Scaffolds were produced using fused deposition modeling
(FDM) as reported in a similar fashion earlier by Van Hoorick et al.
[21] In brief, scaffolds were fabricated using a transparent Poly (Llactic acid) (PLA, Mn: 132400 g/mol and Mw: 166500 g/mol) ﬁlament (Velleman, Gavere, Belgium) in combination with an Ultimaker 1 device (Ultimaker, Geldermalsen, Netherlands). The pore
size (550 mm), printing temperature (210  C), number of layers
(n ¼ 20) and layer height (200 mm) were transferred into a G-code
using an in-house developed scaffold generator v1.8 program
(Ghent University) written in Visual Basic for Applications in
Microsoft Excel 2010. Next, the G-codes driving the circular printing nozzle (diameter 400 mm) were transferred to the Ultimaker 1
using Cura 13.06.4 software (Ultimaker, Geldermalsen). As a result,
porous PLA slabs of 50 mm (length)  50 mm (width)  4 mm
(height) with a lay down pattern of 0/90 were deposited at 11 mm/
s at 210  C in meander. After manufacture, slabs were cut with a
circular metallic puncher to obtain cylindrical scaffolds with a
diameter of 6 mm (Fig. 1A). The mechanical properties of the
scaffolds were determined using a Tinius-Olsen 5ST tensile tester
using a 500 N load cell. Measurements were performed up until
400 N load and analyzed using Horizon software.

2.2. Scaffold surface modiﬁcation
The cylindrical scaffolds were subjected to an argon plasma
using a FEMTO plasma reactor version 3 (Diener Electronic,
Ebhausen, Germany) for 30s at a pressure of 0.8 mbar and a power
of 100 W. Next, the scaffolds were exposed to ambient atmosphere
for 20 min to allow for the reaction of free radicals on the surface
with oxygen to form (hydro)peroxides, as previously reported [22].
To perform the coating, the plasma activated cylindrical PLA scaffolds were immersed into a 2 w/v% gel-MOD (DS 97, see supplementary materials and methods) solution in double distilled water,
containing 2 mol% Irgacure 2959 (BASF, Antwerp, Belgium) (relative to the amount of methacrylamides starting from a stock solution containing 8 mg/ml Irgacure 2959) at 40  C under continuous
magnetic stirring. Next, a 5-min vacuum treatment was performed
to allow sufﬁcient intrusion of the solution throughout the pores of
the scaffolds. Afterwards, the scaffolds were placed on glass slides
and exposed to UV-A irradiation (356 nm, 8 mW/cm2) for 60 min to
induce covalent crosslinking. Finally, the scaffolds were sterilized
by ethylene oxide (AMSCO Eagle 3017, Steris, Antwerp, Belgium)
(Fig. 1A).

C) Top view optical microscopy image of scaffold. D) mCT reconstruction of scaffold: isometric view (left), top view (center) and cross
section (right).

2.3. Characterization of PLA scaffolds
The dimensions (height, diameter, pore size and strut thickness)
of the scaffolds were measured by microscopy and mCT. The
porosity was calculated based on data collected by mCT and helium
pycnometry. Mechanical properties of the PLA scaffolds were obtained using compression tests with compressive forces up to
400 N. More detailed information can be found in the supporting
experimental section.

2.4. Cell lines
Isolation, characterization and culture of human colorectal CAF
were previously described [9,20,23]. SK-OV-3 is a human ovarian
cancer cell line (ATCC number: HTB-77). HCT-8/E11 is a human
colon cancer cell line (ATCC number: CCL-244). SK-OV-3 Luc and
HCT-8/E11 Luc cells were prepared by pFL4.76 plasmid transfection
and selection (Promega). SK-OV-3 Luc eGFP and CAF tdTomato were
obtained by retroviral transduction of pLenti6(Blast)-eGFP-V5 and
pLenti6(Blast)-tdTomato-V5 vectors respectively. All cell lines were
maintained in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM)

(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (penicillin/
streptomycin) and incubated at 37  C with 10% CO2 in air.
Authenticity of ATCC cell lines was conﬁrmed by short tandem
repeat proﬁling. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma
contamination.

2.5. Tumor/control scaffold seeding procedure
Tumor scaffolds were obtained by seeding PLA scaffolds with a
combination of CAF and cancer cells. Seeding density was optimized at 2  106 cancer cells (either SK-OV-3 Luc (eGFP) or HCT-8/
E11 Luc) and 8  106 CAF (CAF tdTomato). For each scaffold, the
pelleted cells were suspended in 0.4 ml 0.2% type I collagen suspension at room temperature. 1 ml 0.2% collagen suspension contains: 454 ml collagen type I (Bioconnect, 100mg/22.68 ml), 182 ml
CMF-HBSS), 72 ml MEM10X, 72 ml NaHCO3, 20 ml NaOH 1 M and
200 ml culture medium [24]. Prior to seeding, scaffolds were incubated at 37  C for 1 h in a 24-well culture plate. During seeding,
temperature was maintained on a plate heater set at 37  C. Seeding
was performed in a 2-ml tube by pipetting the collagen-suspended
cells onto the scaffolds. Passive percolation at atmospheric pressure

for 20s was followed by a 20-s vacuum treatment (N816$3 KN.18
diaphragm pump, KNF, Aartselaar, Belgium). The seeded scaffolds
were subsequently positioned in a 24-well culture plate. Finally, the
seeded scaffolds were inverted after 30 min to reduce gravityinduced remodeling of the collagen suspension and cell distribution inside the scaffold (Fig. 2A). Cell-free scaffolds have undergone
the same seeding procedure with collagen only, without cells, and
are referred to as control scaffolds. After incubation overnight in a
humidiﬁed 10% CO2 atmosphere at 37  C, scaffolds were maintained in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium (DMEM)
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (penicillin/
streptomycin). Medium was refreshed twice a week.

injection of a suspension of 1  106 SK-OV-3 Luc cells (in 250 ml
saline). Small tumors had already spread widely throughout the
peritoneal cavity after 6 weeks. These tumors were parafﬁn
embedded for H&E staining.

2.6. In vitro viability and organization of tumor scaffolds

3. Results

Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was applied to longitudinally
monitor the viability and proliferation of the cancer cells independently from the CAF, as only cancer cells were transferred with
the luciferase gene. Cellular viability was assessed using LIVE/DEAD
staining. Although it provides information about viability, it cannot
distinguish cancer cells from CAF. Cellular organization within the
tumor scaffolds was observed using ﬂuorescently labeled cells (CAF
tdTomato and SK-OV-3 Luc eGFP) and Haematoxylin&Eosin stainings (H&E) on parafﬁn-embedded sections. More detailed information can be found in the supporting experimental section.
Scaffold seeding and viability monitoring was performed multiple
times (>4), 2 representative experiments are shown.

3.1. Synthesis and characterization of the PLA scaffold

2.7. Luminex
On days 1, 3 and 8 of HCT-8/E11 and CAF cultures, aliquots of
supernatant were collected and subjected to secretome analysis
using Luminex multiplex arrays by Eve Technologies (Calgary, AB
Canada). Discovery assays used are Human Cytokine Array/Chemokine Array 65-Plex Panel (HD65) and Human Angiogenesis
Array & Growth Factor 17-plex Array (HDAGP17). All samples were
assayed at least in duplicate and prepared standards were included
in all runs. In the analysis, baseline media analyte levels were
accounted for.
2.8. In vivo experiments
Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the
regulatory guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the Ghent University Hospital. A total of 6 female athymic Swiss Nu/nu mice
(Charles River) at 6 weeks of age were used for xenograft studies
and kept in standard housing conditions with water and food ad
libitum. Tumor scaffolds (n ¼ 6), seeded with SK-OV-3 Luc eGFP and
CAF tdTomato 3 weeks prior to intraperitoneal implantation, were
sutured to the parietal peritoneum of the right lower abdominal
quadrant. As a control, four of these mice were sutured cell-free/
control scaffolds (n ¼ 4) to the parietal peritoneum of the left
lower abdominal quadrant. Cancer cell growth was monitored
weekly by bioluminescence imaging. Blood vessel inﬁltration was
in vivo visualized and quantiﬁed by contrast-enhanced mCT using
the X-Cube cone beam mCT (MOLECUBES NV, Ghent, Belgium) at 4
weeks post implantation (4/6 mice). At this time point, two mice
were sacriﬁced and the implanted scaffolds were harvested for
H&E and immunohistochemical stainings. At the endpoint, 12e14
weeks post implantation, in vivo and ex vivo contrast-enhanced mCT
scans were performed (4/6 mice). Finally, the tumor and control
scaffolds were parafﬁn embedded for H&E stainings (Fig. 3A and B).
Data is shown from two independent experiments. More detailed
information can be found in the supporting experimental section.
The traditional mouse model was obtained by intraperitoneal

2.9. Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5.03.
Blood vessel inﬁltration was analyzed by Mann-Whitney U onetailed tests, correlations were analyzed with Spearman's rank correlation coefﬁcients. Differences with p < .05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Polymer-based scaffolds, such as polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds,
ensure mechanical stability, high porosity and that size and shape
requirements are met. Fused deposition modeling (FDM), a
manufacturing technology that lays down molten polymer in additive layers with a 3D printer, is applied to generate scaffolds from
PLA ﬁlaments. The surface of the PLA scaffolds is coated with
gelatin to increase cellular interactivity. In short, scaffolds are argon
plasma treated and consequently dip coated in a 2 w/v% gel-MOD
(cross-linkable gelatin) solution containing 2 mol% Irgacure 2959
which is cross-linked through UV-A irradiation (Fig. 1A). The stiffness of the PLA scaffolds is assessed by a compression test, a
Young's modulus of 115.6 MPa ± 14.6 MPa and an onset of deformation at around 10 MPa (yield strength) (Fig. 1B, Table 1). The
controlled architecture of the scaffolds is analyzed through microscopy and mCT. Pores and struts have reproducible sizes, even at
the edges of the scaffold, with an average of 599 mm ± 28 mm and
347 mm ± 17 mm respectively (Fig. 1CeD). The large pores and struts
result in a high porosity; about 2/3 of the volume of the scaffold is
available for cell/tissue inﬁltration. However, there are some discrepancies between measurement tools. mCT results in 59.02%
(±2.09%) porosity whereas helium pycnometry indicates a porosity
of 71.08% (±3.14%) (Table 1). Differences can be explained by resolution limitation of mCT (8  8  8 mm3) and selected cut-off
values.
3.2. CAF stimulate 3D cancer cell colonization in PLA scaffolds
PLA scaffolds are 3D colonized by co-seeding luciferase positive
cancer cells with human CAF in a suspension of type I collagen
(Fig. 2A). Type I collagen, a gel-forming ECM protein, ﬁlls the void
space in scaffolds and supports 3D growth of cells. Vacuum pressure enables the collagen/cell mixture to reach the center of the
scaffolds. Upon geliﬁcation, single cells are randomly dispersed in
the collagen-occupied voids of the scaffold. Both HCT-8/E11 colon
cancer cells (Fig. S1A) and SK-O-V-3 ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 2B)
show an initial bioluminescent signal that drops within the ﬁrst
days and starts to recover at the end of week 2. Importantly, coseeding of cancer cells with CAF surges the initial bioluminescent
signal and signal intensity is correlated with increasing CAF
numbers. The four-to-one ratio of the number of CAF to the number
of cancer cells shows the highest initial bioluminescent signal,
which remains stable over a two-week period (Fig. 2B). Scaffolds
with the four-to-one ratio were maintained in long-term culture
and monitored by phase-contrast microscopy and bioluminescence
(Fig. 2C). Within this long-term period, four stages of cellular organization are identiﬁed in the scaffolds seeded with a combination
of SK-OV-3 and CAF: adhesion/selection, recovery, spheroid formation and exponential growth phase (Fig. 2C); whereas only two

stages are identiﬁed in the scaffolds seeded with a combination of
HCT-8/E11 and CAF: adhesion/selection and spheroid formation/
exponential growth (Fig. S1B). HCT-8/E11 cells have, in contrast to
SK-OV-3 cells, strong E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion,
which is most probably responsible for rapid spheroid formation
[25]. LIVE/DEAD staining at week 5 shows high viability of cells
both within spheroids and adhered to struts (Fig. 2D). Cells adhered
to struts are oriented in the print direction of the scaffold, parallel
to the movement of the printing nozzle. Occasionally, cells connecting both a vertical and horizontal strut are observed (Fig. 2E).
eGFP expressing SK-OV-3 cells form heterocellular spheroids with
tdTomato expressing CAF as well as homocellular monolayers
attached to struts. In general, CAF do not grow on struts but are only
present within spheroids, making up to 30% of the spheroid cell
number. This organization is conﬁrmed by H&E staining of parafﬁnembedded sections; basophilic (afﬁnity to haematoxylin) cancer
cells are organized into monolayers adhered to struts, whereas
spheroids contain both basophilic cancer cells and eosinophilic
(afﬁnity to eosin) CAF/matrix (Fig. 2F and G). Similarly, HCT-8/
E11 cells not only grow as monolayers attached to struts but also as
spheroids, although there is clearly more cancer cell-CAF intermingling in spheroids with SK-OV-3 cancer cells than occurs with
HCT-8/E11 cancer cells. In fact, HCT-8/E11 spheroids have a central
core of HCT-8/E11 cancer cells, surrounded by a CAF-rich matrix
(Fig. S1C). Above all, bioluminescence imaging, ﬂuorescence microscopy and histological data show that CAF are essential for
cancer cell colonization and formation of a tumor scaffold in vitro.
3.3. In vivo evaluation of tumor scaffolds and inﬁltrated cells
We further explored whether tumor scaffolds could be used as
an orthotopic peritoneal metastasis model. Tumor scaffolds were
maintained in vitro for 3 weeks prior to surgical implantation to the
peritoneal wall at the right lower quadrant of the peritoneal cavity.
This time window is crucial for the cancer cells to recover and to
form spheroids (microscopic Fig. 2C bottom panel; macroscopic
Fig. 3A). Interestingly, phase-contrast microscopy reveals that type I
collagen hydrogels are initially intact, but then contract over time,
most likely through CAF-mediated contractile activity, resulting in
the creation of voids within the scaffolds, which in turn allows

101

space for both host cell inﬁltration and vascularization in vivo
(Fig. 2C). In 4 out of 6 mice, a control scaffold (collagen-PLA [gelMOD]; no cells) was added to the left lower quadrant. The bioluminescent activity of the cancer cells in the scaffolds was longitudinally monitored. In 3 out of 6 mice, a steep decrease in
bioluminescent signal in the ﬁrst week after implantation was
observed, which showed recovery by the second week (Fig. 3BeC).
This could reﬂect a temporal drop in cancer cell viability or an
insufﬁcient distribution of the luciferin within the scaffold. Longterm follow-up reveals an exponential increase of a localized
bioluminescent signal at the scaffold implantation area. At 4 weeks
post implantation, the scaffolds contain clusters of cancer cells and
CAF surrounded by mouse ﬁbroblasts, adipocytes, inﬂammatory
cells and endothelial cells, forming heterogeneous tumor tissue. At
the intersection between the scaffold and the peritoneal wall, an
intimate interaction between the tumor and the muscle cells is
observed (Fig. 3D). Mesothelial cells do not cover the scaffold.
Immunohistochemical staining with a human speciﬁc antivimentin antibody and a cross-species anti-aSMA antibody indicates the presence of inﬁltrating mouse CAF surrounding cancer
cells and human co-seeded CAF (Fig. 3E). Blood vessels are clearly
visible on the H&E sections (Fig. 3D); the wide distribution of blood
vessels throughout the scaffold is in agreement with the absence of
necrotic areas. The area of blood vessels correlates (R ¼ 1,
p ¼ .0083) with the bioluminescent signal of the cancer cells in the
scaffold (Fig. S2B). Peri- and intra-tumor scaffold vascularization is
evidenced by ex vivo macroscopic evaluation (Fig. 4AeB shows preand post-implanted scaffolds) and contrast-enhanced mCT both
in vivo (Fig. 4CeD) and ex vivo (Fig. 4E). Tissue sections of the
scaffold show that CD31 positive vessels are covered by aSMA
positive pericytes (Fig. 4F). Peri-tumor scaffold branching of vessels
is observed ex vivo macroscopically and in vivo using mCT. Video 1
demonstrates a blood vessel following the inner lining of the
peritoneal wall until the tumor scaffold, where it bends 90 to enter
the scaffold. Video 2 is a 3D reconstruction of the same tumor
scaffold. Contrast-enhanced mCT shows a 15-fold increase
(p ¼ .0147) in the blood vessel volume in an 8-week time period
(week 4: 0.06 vol % blood vessel (IQR ¼ 0.03e0.48), week 12:
5.18 vol % blood vessel (IQR ¼ 3.42e5.60)) (Fig. 4G). Tissue exposure
to biomaterials triggers a foreign body response (FBR) characterized by inﬂammatory cell recruitment and ﬁbrosis-induced vessel
regression. To evaluate the FBR to PLA scaffolds, control scaffolds
were peritoneally implanted. H&E staining shows that control
scaffolds are inﬁltrated by inﬂammatory cells, ﬁbroblasts and small
blood vessels. Although blood vessels are present, robust neovascularization is not observed since the blood vessel volume
percentage is 3.97-fold lower (p ¼ .0495) in control scaffolds
(0.06 vol % blood vessel (IQR ¼ 0.008e2.88)) compared to tumor
scaffolds (5.05 vol % blood vessel (IQR ¼ 1.71e5.50)) (Fig. 4GeH).
This suggests an active and sustained cancer cell/CAF-dependent
recruitment and organization of blood vessels in tumor scaffolds.

compared the histological organization of 1) a peritoneally
implanted SK-OV-3 tumor scaffold, 2) a patient-derived ovarian
cancer peritoneal metastasis removed during cytoreductive surgery
and 3) an ovarian xenograft tumor obtained by intraperitoneal injection of SK-OV-3 single cell suspension (traditional xenograft)
(Fig. 4J). The heterocellular nature of the tumor scaffold is similar to
what we observe in patient samples: nests of cancer cells surrounded by stroma. This morphology resembles the cancer cell/CAF
spheroid formation in the tumor scaffolds. Tumor scaffolds and
patient-derived samples abundantly contain pericyte-covered
(aSMA positive) blood vessels, whereas intraperitoneally injected
SK-OV-3 cells form small peritoneal metastases with only occasional blood vessels. The organization of aSMA positive ﬁbroblasts
is different between traditional xenografts and patient-derived
samples/tumor scaffolds. In traditional xenografts, occasional
aSMA positive ﬁbroblasts tightly adhere to the periphery of SK-OV3 nests in one to three layers. In tumor scaffolds and patientderived samples, however, aSMA positive ﬁbroblasts are arranged
in a multilayered network pattern in close contact with cancer cells.
Furthermore, numbers of CAF occasionally exceed those of cancer
cells. Inﬂammation, an intricate part of tumor progression, is
characterized by presence of CD68 positive macrophages in tumor
scaffolds and patient samples. However, CD68 positive macrophages are not observed in traditional SK-OV-3 xenografts. In
conclusion, peritoneally implanted SK-OV-3 tumor scaffolds and
patient-derived tumor tissue show a similar morphological, blood
vessel and (aSMA positive) ﬁbroblast organization as well as (CD68
positive) macrophage inﬁltration.
An FBR to a cell-free/control scaffold is characterized by inﬁltration of host cells similar like those observed in a tumor scaffold,
but to a spatial different and quantitative lesser extent. To understand why tumor scaffolds more truthfully mimic a patient-derived
peritoneal metastasis compared to intraperitoneal injection of SKOV-3 cells or an FBR to the hybrid hydrogel-PLA scaffold, we
decided to investigate the secretome of both cancer cells and CAF.
Secretory products such as chemokines, cytokines and growth
factors serve paracrine communication with the host and are
responsible for tumor inﬁltration of macrophages, endothelial cells,
ﬁbroblasts and pericytes. While some growth factors/cytokines/
chemokines are similarly secreted by both cancer cells and CAF
(CXCL10, GROa, VEGF-A, angiopoietin-2, FGF-2, IL-8, IFNa2), others
are uniquely secreted by the cancer cells (CX3CL1, eotaxin-2, MIP1a, Rantes, MDC, LIF, IL-28a, IL-1a, TGFa, GM-CSF, PDGF-AA, PDGFBB, SCF, TNFa, HB-EGF, PLGF) and others are uniquely secreted by
the CAF (eotaxin-1, MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, SDF-1a&b, ENA78, IL-15, IL-6, IL-23, Flt-3L, endoglin, follistatin, SF/HGF, VEGF-C)
(Fig. S3 and Table S1). Thus, the complementary secretory proﬁle
of growth factors/chemokines/cytokines by both cancer cells and
CAF is most probably responsible for recruitment and organization
of host cells in tumor scaffolds as similarly observed in ovarian
cancer patient-derived peritoneal metastases.

4. Discussion
Key features of the design include a type I collagen hydrogel to
imbibe and trap cells in a gel phase, and vacuum pressure to allow
distribution of the cell-laden hydrogel throughout all pores of the
network. Notably, in the absence of the collagen hydrogel, cells ﬂow
through the pores network of the scaffold without adhering to the
PLA substrate, even though it was activated by argon plasma
treatment and subsequently coated with gel-MOD. Furthermore,
PLA scaffolds can be designed into any desired size and shape with
relatively high mechanical strength and they can be sutured onto
biological surfaces such as the peritoneum. Peritoneal metastases
are dome-shaped elevations on the peritoneal surface and their size
is of clinical importance since intraperitoneal chemotherapy has
limited survival beneﬁt in patients with peritoneal metastases
exceeding the size of 5.0 mm for ovarian cancer [4] and 2.5 mm for
colon cancer [5]. The established technology of FDM enables
manufacture of peritoneal metastases with tunable properties,
such as weight, size and shape, being therefore superior to traditional peritoneal metastasis models in terms of (clinically relevant)
spatial dimensions.
Since solid tumors are more than a mass of genetically altered
cells (i.e. the cancer cells), scaffolds were co-seeded with cancer
cells and ﬁbroblasts, which are abundantly present in the tumor
microenvironment (i.e. so-called cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts,
CAF). Interestingly, in absence of CAF, cancer cells (both ovarian SKOV-3 and colorectal HCT-8/E11 cells) prefer to adhere to and grow
on the scaffolds' struts, suggesting 2D growth on a 3D substrate.
CAF, however, promote the formation of heterocellular spheroids
within the hydrogel-occupied pores of the scaffold, a process
strongly dependent upon the CAF seeding number. Indeed,
spheroid formation is profoundly inﬂuenced by CAF through
paracrine signaling [26e28]. Furthermore, Chen et al. found that
CAF-induced spheroid formation led to the sustaining of cancer cell
stemness [27]. In ovarian cancer, there is strong evidence that
spheroids originating from malignancy-related ascites exhibit
increased tumorigenic capacity in vivo, potentially seed metastatic
lesions and could be correlated with therapy resistance [29,30].
Besides spheroid formation, we have observed a signiﬁcant difference in cancer cell viability; all CAF seeding numbers increased
cancer cell survival, an effect that exponentially increased with
increasing CAF numbers. This is consistent with prior related
in vitro studies that have shown increased viability of cancer cells
co-cultured with CAF. In these studies, the ﬁbroblast-mediated
increase in viability was attributable to growth factors and chemokines such as SF/HGF, NRG1, SDF1, among others [20,31,32]. CAF
support tumorigenesis through various mechanisms, including
cancer cell stemness, proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis.
Furthermore, clinical data demonstrated that stromal characteristics, such as the carcinoma-stroma ratio [33e37] and the stromal
gene signature [38,39], can predict patient survival and are

correlated with poor prognosis.
An FBR is mainly mediated by macrophages as inducers of
ﬁbrotic encapsulation via VEGF release and neovascularization [18].
Accordingly, an FBR is likely to occur in T and B cell immunodeﬁcient mice commonly used in xenograft models. An FBR is in general undesirable and can be deleterious to the function of the
implanted tumor scaffold. Several aspects indicate that the host cell
response to the implanted tumor scaffold is not merely an FBR but
an active, controlled recruitment of host cells by paracrine factors
produced by the tumor scaffold. Firstly, rapid contraction of
collagen hydrogels in vitro is the result of contractile forces generated by CAF, which in turn determines the new tissue formation
in vivo by allowing space and structural support for host cell inﬁltration and vascularization. Secondly, the scaffolds were maintained up to 14 weeks without the appearance of thick ﬁbrotic
tissue at the contact area between the implanted scaffold and the
host. In contrast, a typical FBR occurs within 4 weeks after scaffold
implantation. Thirdly, blood vessel inﬁltration correlates with
growth and viability of cancer cells in the tumor scaffold. Fourthly, a
control scaffold without cells shows a 4-fold lower neovascularization compared to a tumor scaffold. This highlights the
importance of cancer cell/CAF-derived paracrine factors in the
recruitment of pericyte-covered (aSMA positive) CD31 expressing
endothelial cells. Fifthly, cancer cells and CAF produce a complementary cocktail of factors implicated in the stimulation of neovascularization. While macrophage-derived VEGF is mainly the
initiator of an FBR, tumor scaffolds produce VEGF supplemented
with pro-angiogenic factors such as PDGF family members, SF/HGF,
PLGF, among others. Sixthly, the complementary pro-angiogenic
cocktail that shows a sustained release (data not shown) is most
probably responsible for the 15-fold increase in blood vessel volume over an 8-week time period. And lastly, CD68 positive macrophages did not accumulate at the scaffold-host interface but
showed close association with cancer cell nests as is similarly
observed in a patient-derived peritoneal metastasis.
An important aspect is whether the tumor hybrid scaffold is
superior to traditional tumor models in preclinical drug testing. A
commonly used model is the intraperitoneal injection of a cancer
cell suspension, which simulates the process of peritoneal
dissemination in intra-abdominal cancers. However, it is difﬁcult to
achieve heterologous growth of human cancer cell lines in the
abdominal cavity of nude mice by direct intraperitoneal injection
due to the acute conversion from an adherent-dependent to a
suspension-dependent type of survival of the human cancer cells.
Direct intraperitoneal injection of 1  106 SK-OV-3 cells in nude
mice results in a long latency and in a small number of palpable
tumor nodes [10]. Histological analysis revealed necrotic areas and
minimal stromal contribution of both CAF and blood vessels to
tumorigenesis in this traditional peritoneal metastasis model. This
stands in stark contrast with a patient-derived peritoneal metastasis showing abundant stromal components intermingled between multicellular clusters of cancer cells. Of interest, tumor
scaffolds implanted on the peritoneum are histologically similar to
native tumor tissue; in addition to multicellular clusters of cancer
cells, they also contain a multilayered network composed of aSMA
positive ﬁbroblasts, a pericyte-stabilized vascular network and
inﬁltrating immune cells.
Models that truthfully mimic peritoneal metastases are important for the preclinical evaluation of intraperitoneal drug delivery
[40]. The uptake of both low-molecular-weight and high-molecular-weight drugs is strongly inﬂuenced by stromal-environmental
factors in peritoneal metastases. Peritoneal metastases have a
raised interstitial ﬂuid pressure due to stiff stroma (established by
extracellular matrix-producing CAF) and leaky blood vessels
[41,42]. In addition, there are several reports on chemotherapy

scavenging of CAF, thus reducing the availability of these drugs to
nearby cancer cells. The tumor scaffold model in this study differs
from most peritoneal metastasis models, because of its consistency
in size and the marked histological similarity to patient-derived
peritoneal metastases. Furthermore, this model allows the longitudinal use of advanced in vivo techniques (bioluminescence and
mCT). Lastly, speciﬁc size-dependent aspects of tumor biology such
as oxygenation, perfusion and interstitial ﬂuid pressure may be
evaluated more accurately.
In conclusion, we have tissue-engineered and characterized a
new implantable scaffold model based on the human tumor
microenvironment. Our ﬁndings underscore that CAF enhance both
cancer cell survival and angiogenesis by offering a privileged
environment. Our approach describes another step forward in
recapitulating the multifaceted tumor microenvironment by
increasing complexity of tissue-engineered tumor models. It is
likely that the scaffold model could be further developed as a
platform technology that may enable mechanistic studies for drug
penetration and efﬁcacy after intraperitoneal chemotherapy
delivery.
